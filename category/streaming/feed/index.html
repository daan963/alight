<p>NFR Bareback Riding is one of the premier events at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), a championship rodeo event held annually in the United States. In this event, a rider must stay on a bucking horse and can only hang on with a &#8220;rigging&#8221; attached by a cinch and latigos.</p>



<p>The rigging used in Bareback Riding is leather and resembles a suitcase handle on a strap. This strap is placed atop the horse&#8217;s withers and secured with a cinch.&nbsp;The rider aims to stay on the horse and not get disqualified.</p>



<p>As the bronc and rider burst from the chute, the rider must have both spurs touching the horse&#8217;s shoulders until the horse&#8217;s feet hit the ground after coming from the chute. This is called &#8220;marking out.&#8221; If the cowboy fails to do this, he is disqualified.</p>



<p>The rider is judged on his control, spurring technique, and the degree to which his toes remain turned out while he is spurring.&nbsp;The horse is also scored, and the rider with the highest total wins.&nbsp;The rider&#8217;s holding arm absorbs most of the horse&#8217;s bucking power.</p>



<p>Bareback Riding is often compared to riding a jackhammer with one hand due to the strength and control required.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a thrilling event that showcases the skill and bravery of the riders, as well as the power and agility of the horses.</p>



<p>The NFR showcases the talents of the PRCA&#8217;s top 15 money winners in the season for each event, including Bareback Riding.</p>

<p>NFR Steer Wrestling, also known as bulldogging, is a high-octane rodeo event showcasing the competitors&#8217; strength, speed, and technique. It is one of the premier events at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), a championship rodeo event held annually in the United States.</p>



<p>In this event, a horse-mounted rider, known as a bulldogger, chases a steer, drops from the horse to the steer, and then wrestles the steer to the ground. The bulldogger does this by grabbing the steer&#8217;s horns and pulling it off-balance so that it falls to the ground.&nbsp;The steer generally weighs over twice as much as the cowboy trying to throw it, making this event one of the most challenging in rodeo.</p>



<p>The event starts with the bulldogger and his hazer (a second rider who keeps the steer running straight) on either side of the steer’s chute. The steer has a head start, maintained by a rope around the steer tied to a barrier in front of the two riders’ horses. If the bulldogger breaks the barrier before the steer reaches its head start, a 10-second penalty is assessed.</p>



<p>The barrier is released once the steer reaches the advantage point, and the bulldogger takes off in pursuit. The bulldogger then attempts to catch up to the running steer, lean over the side of the horse, and grab the horns of the running steer.</p>



<p>The bulldogger is then pulled off his horse by the slowing steer and plants his heels into the dirt, further slowing the steer and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, reaches down, and grabs the nose of the steer, pulling the steer off balance and ultimately &#8220;throwing&#8221; the steer to the ground.</p>



<p>Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end, and a time is taken.</p>



<p>The objective of steer wrestling is to wrestle the steer to the ground as quickly as possible. The contestant with the fastest time wins.&nbsp;The modern world record for steer wrestling is 2.4 seconds, making it the quickest event in rodeo.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Team Roping</h3>



<p>Team roping is a rodeo event where two highly rated riders compete professionally. One is the header, and the other is the heeler&nbsp;here.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Header</strong>: The first&nbsp;mounted contestant&nbsp;is the &#8220;header&#8221; who opens the front of the steer. Then he&nbsp;wraps the rope end around the saddle horn&nbsp;and the head or around the neck as fast as he can.&nbsp;This process is&nbsp;known as a dally.</li>



<li><strong>Heelers</strong>: Once the steer has been caught, both contestants turn it left so the heeler can rope the hind legs. Then, the heeler must rope on both hind legs to avoid the five-second penalty assessed at the end time.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tie-Down Roping</h3>



<p>Tie-Down Roping, also known as calf roping, is a timed rodeo event where a rider on horseback attempts to rope a calf around the neck with a lariat, dismount, and then tie three of the calf&#8217;s legs together in the shortest time possible. The calf is given a head start, and the roper must catch it within a specific area, often marked by a barrier.</p>



<p>The NFR is a prestigious event in rodeo, attracting top rodeo athletes who compete in various events, including Tie-Down Roping, for substantial prize money and the chance to be crowned world champions in their respective disciplines. The NFR usually takes place annually in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

<p>Barrel racing is a timed speed and agility event where a horse and rider attempt to run a cloverleaf pattern around three preset barrels in the fastest time.&nbsp;The rider&#8217;s horsemanship skills and the horse&#8217;s athletic ability are crucial to maneuver the horse around the barrels successfully.&nbsp;However, these skills are not judged; the winner is determined solely by who can run the barrel-racing pattern in the fastest time.</p>



<p>In professional, collegiate, and high school rodeo, barrel racing is primarily a women&#8217;s sport, though men and boys occasionally compete at local and amateur levels.&nbsp;The event requires a combination of the horse&#8217;s athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider.</p>



<p>The NFR is held each year in the first full week of December at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus.&nbsp;The finals consist of 10 go-rounds that test the mettle of finalists in their quest for a world champion title.&nbsp;Competitors often compete at 40, 50, and 60 rodeos yearly to climb the national standings and qualify for the NFR.</p>



<p>Barrel racing was added to the NFR in 1967, and today, it is one of the most popular rodeo events.&nbsp;The event is intense and exciting for riders and spectators and has gained significant popularity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bull Riding</h3>



<p>Bull riding is an event where cowboys attempt to ride full-grown bucking bulls for eight seconds.&nbsp;Each successful ride is then judged for a maximum score of 100 points. The more difficult the bull is to ride and the more control the cowboy has during the ride, the higher the score.&nbsp;The cowboy with the highest score wins.</p>



<p>The NFR is held each year in the first full week of December at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus.&nbsp;The finals consist of 10 rounds that test the mettle of finalists in their quest for a world champion title.&nbsp;Competitors often compete at numerous rodeos yearly to climb the national standings and qualify for the NFR.</p>



<p>Bull riding was one of the original seven main events when the NFR was established 1958.&nbsp;Today, it remains one of the most popular and thrilling events for riders and spectators.&nbsp;The event requires not only the cowboy&#8217;s skill and courage but also the bull&#8217;s athleticism, contributing to half of the total score.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">All-Around Champion</h3>



<p>The NFR (National Finals Rodeo) All-Around Champion is an award given to the rodeo competitor who is most successful in two or more events. The award is determined by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).</p>



<p>It is given to the competitor who wins the most prizes in a year while competing in at least two events, earning a minimum of $3,000 in each event.</p>



<p>The All-Around World Championship is awarded at the National Finals Rodeo, held every December at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>



<p>The All-Around Champion is considered by many to be the most talented and versatile cowboy in the sport.&nbsp;Some notable All-Around Champions include Stetson Wright, who won the title in 2020, 2021, and 2022, and Trevor Brazile, who holds the single-season record for the most money won in a season at $507,921 during the 2010 campaign.</p>



<p>The NFR features the top 15 competitors in each event, and winning the All-Around Championship means a competitor was the best among an all-star cast.&nbsp;However, it&#8217;s important to note that a competitor can win the NFR All-Around Championship but fall short of clinching the world title, as world titles are based on money earnings throughout the regular season and at the NFR.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Bowl of Rodeo</h2>



<p>The &#8220;Super Bowl of Rodeo&#8221; is a popular name for the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), an annual championship event held by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).</p>



<p>The NFR was established in 1958 to determine the world champion in each rodeo&#8217;s seven main events: calf roping, steer wrestling, bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, team roping, and steer roping.&nbsp;The world championship steer roping competition is always held separately from the regular NFR.</p>
