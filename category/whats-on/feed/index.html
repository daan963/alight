										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2023 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (WNFR) is set to kick off with the breakaway roping competition on December 5, 2023, at the South Point Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The top 15 breakaway ropers will compete for the coveted Montana Silversmith gold buckle and a share of the $250,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>All 10 rounds of competition will be streamed live for free on the <a href="https://wranglernetwork.com/">Wrangler Network</a>. The pre-show and opening ceremonies will begin at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time, followed by the competition at 2:00 p.m. PT.</p>
<p>Shelby Boisjoli Meged comes into the WNFR ranked number one with $164,549 in earnings. Hali Williams, the daughter of Hall of Fame cowboy Speed Williams, will be making her WNFR debut ranked second. Williams is just $17,806 behind Meged in the standings.</p>
<p>The field of 13 ropers also includes reigning World Champion Martha Angelone and multiple time World Champion Jackie Hobbs Crawford.</p>
<p>The sport of breakaway has exploded in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to the combined efforts of the Women&#8217;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The two associations sanctioned more than 450 rodeos that included breakaway in the 2023 season, up from just 30 rodeos in the inaugural year of 2019.</p>
<p>Each round of the WNFR breakaway roping competition will pay $5,080.08 to the champion, $4,204.20 for second, $3,328.33 for third, $2,452.45 for fourth, $1,576.58 for fifth, and $875.88 for sixth. The average will award the champion $13,866.13 for the fastest combined time on 10 head.</p>
<p>Fans can tune in to the Wrangler Network today to watch the breakaway ropers compete for the coveted Montana Silversmith gold buckle.</p>

<h2><span id="Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_NFR">Everything You Need to Know About NFR</span></h2>
<p>Beyond the payouts for the Cowboys, the PRCA estimates that the event brings in about <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rodeo/national-finals-rodeo/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-national-finals-rodeo/">$90 million annually to the Las Vegas economy</a>. Furthermore, recent attendance stats have shown that 177,565 rodeo enthusiasts decked out in Wrangler jeans, Justin boots and cowboy hats attended events at the Thomas &amp; Mack with an additional 40,000 fans who watched at the 40 hotels who hosted watch parties. It is during this rare time of the year that many marquees on the Strip have the face of bull riders replace DJs’ faces.</p>
<h2><span id="Main_Events">Main Performance<br />
</span></h2>
<p>Seven main events have historically taken place at the NFR. Each event has its own monetary prizes that are paid out, and those payouts are determined by each top-placing competitor’s rank in relation to the event’s overall prize pool. Individuals placed in the top-six of a particular event are paid out accordingly, while individuals placed in the top-eight of the overall NFR are also paid out. The NFR’s main events are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span id="Bareback_Riding">Bareback Riding</span></h3>
<p>This consists of a horseback cowboy using a bareback rigging as the primary means of staying on top of the horse. This grip has often been compared to the equivalent of hanging on to a suitcase handle and makes for the only support that a cowboy has on top of the wildly bucking horse. An 8-second ride constitutes a qualified ride and the cowboys is judged on riding technique.</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="Steer_Wrestling">Steer Wrestling</span></h3>
<p>This act involves a horseback steer wrestler, alternatively known as a “bulldogger”, bringing a fast-moving steer to a halt on its back as fast as possible. The bulldogger utilizes a combination of strength, technique, speed, and precision to jump off of their horse from a designated starting point and onto a steer sprinting off from the same starting point.</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="Team_Roping">Team Roping</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<h4><span id="Headers">Headers</span></h4>
<p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope the head of the steer in one of three tries as fast as possible; around both horns, around one horn and the head, or around the neck.</li>
<li>
<h4><span id="Heelers">Heelers</span></h4>
<p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope the hind legs of the steer as soon as the header has successfully done their part. To avoid a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg, the heeler must rope both hind legs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="Saddle_Bron_Riding">Saddle Bron Riding</span></h3>
<p>Similar to Bareback Riding, the goal of the horseback cowboy is to maintain their balance as much as possible for 8 seconds while the horse is bucking. In this event, however, the cowboy sits on a saddle while using one hand to hold on to a thick rein that’s attached to the horse’s halter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span id="Tie-Down_Roping">Tie-Down Roping</span></h3>
<p>This event centers around a cowboy on horseback attempting to restrain a calf by throwing a well-timed rope loop that’s attached to the cowboy’s horse. The cowboy and the calf both leave from a designated starting point, with the calf getting a slight head-start. The cowboy depends on the horse to mitigate any slack in the rope after dismounting, then proceeds to tie-up the calf as fast as possible.</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="Barrel_Racing">Barrel Racing</span></h3>
<p>This is a women’s event where horseback cowgirls race against the clock to complete a strategically set course where barrels are set up as landmarks. The intent is for the cowgirls to complete a cloverleaf-shaped run around 3 barrels placed in a triangular formation as fast as possible. Barrels that are accidentally knocked over result in 5-second penalties.</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="Bull_Riding">Bull Riding</span></h3>
<p>The cowboy on top of the bull has the main objective of staying on top and maintaining their balance for 8 seconds. They are judged based on technique and can earn extra points by spurring while the bull is bucking. The cowboy stays on top of the bull by grasping a flat braided rope, which also wraps around the bull’s chest.</li>
<li>
<h3><span id="All-Around_Champion">All-Around Champion</span></h3>
<p>Being crowned the All-Around Champion speaks volumes about the versatility and high level of talent exhibited by the winning cowboy.  In order to receive this honor, the cowboy must have won the most prize money in a given year and competed in at least 2 NFR events while earning at least $3,000 in each of those events. This is widely known as the highest honor bestowed by the PRCA.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Contestants">Contestants</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bareback riding is a captivating equestrian discipline that showcases the remarkable harmony between a horse and its rider. It is a form of horseback riding where the rider forgoes the use of a saddle, relying solely on their balance and skill to stay atop the horse. This style of riding dates back centuries and holds a special place in the hearts of horse enthusiasts and riders alike. Let&#8217;s delve deeper into the world of bareback riding, uncovering its history, techniques, safety measures, and more.</p>
<h3>The History of Bareback Riding</h3>
<p>Bareback riding traces its origins to ancient times when horses were essential for transportation, warfare, and agriculture. Initially, the practice of riding without a saddle was born out of necessity, as primitive communities lacked the resources to craft elaborate riding gear. Over time, this evolved into a specialized art form, demonstrating the exceptional bond between humans and horses.</p>
<h3>Bareback Riding vs. Saddle Riding: Understanding the Difference</h3>
<p>While both bareback riding and saddle riding involve mounting a horse, they differ significantly in terms of technique and experience. Saddle riding provides a stable platform and support for the rider, allowing for a more secure grip and precise control. On the contrary, bareback riding demands a higher level of balance, coordination, and finesse, as the rider must rely solely on their body to maintain equilibrium.</p>
<h3>The Anatomy of a Bareback Ride</h3>
<h4>Understanding the Horse&#8217;s Anatomy</h4>
<p>A fundamental aspect of bareback riding is understanding the anatomy of the horse. A rider must be aware of the horse&#8217;s skeletal structure, muscle groups, and movement patterns to anticipate its behavior and adjust their posture accordingly.</p>
<h4>Mastering Balance and Control</h4>
<p>Achieving balance and control while bareback riding is a skill that requires practice and patience. Riders must develop a strong core and leg muscles to maintain stability and effectively communicate with the horse through subtle shifts in weight and pressure.</p>
<h4>Using Leg Pressure Effectively</h4>
<p>Leg pressure serves as a primary means of communication between the rider and the horse. By applying subtle cues through leg pressure, riders can guide the horse&#8217;s movements and communicate commands effectively.</p>
<h3>Training for Bareback Riding: Techniques and Tips</h3>
<p>To excel in bareback riding, dedicated training and consistent practice are essential. Strengthening core muscles, fostering a deep connection with the horse, and perfecting balance are crucial elements of effective training.</p>
<h4>Strengthening the Core Muscles</h4>
<p>A robust core is the foundation of a successful bareback ride. Engaging in exercises that target the abdominal, back, and pelvic muscles can significantly improve a rider&#8217;s stability and endurance.</p>
<h4>Developing a Connection with the Horse</h4>
<p>Establishing trust and rapport with the horse is pivotal for a seamless bareback riding experience. Spending quality time with the horse, grooming, and understanding its behavior fosters a strong bond built on mutual respect and understanding.</p>
<h4>Perfecting the Balance</h4>
<p>Achieving balance on a moving horse is an art that demands continuous refinement. Riders can practice various exercises and drills to enhance their equilibrium and coordination, enabling them to adapt to the horse&#8217;s movements effortlessly.</p>
<h3>The Adrenaline Rush of Bareback Riding: Why Riders Love It</h3>
<p>Bareback riding offers an unparalleled adrenaline rush, combining the thrill of speed, agility, and the raw power of the horse. The intimate connection between the rider and the horse creates an exhilarating experience that heightens the senses and fosters a deep appreciation for the art of equestrianism.</p>
<h3>Safety Measures for Bareback Riding</h3>
<p>While bareback riding is exhilarating, it comes with inherent risks that necessitate precautionary measures. Wearing appropriate safety gear, understanding the horse&#8217;s behavior, and practicing in controlled environments are crucial steps to ensure the safety and well-being of both the rider and the horse.</p>
<h3>Famous Bareback Riding Competitions and Events Around the World</h3>
<p>Bareback riding has evolved into a popular sport with a dedicated fan base and prestigious competitions worldwide. Events such as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bareback Riding Championship and the Calgary Stampede showcase the finest bareback riders competing for coveted titles and prizes, drawing crowds from all corners of the globe.</p>
<h3>The Art of Bareback Riding: A Spectator&#8217;s Guide</h3>
<p>For spectators, bareback riding offers a captivating display of skill, athleticism, and the unbreakable bond between human and animal. Observing the seamless synchronization between rider and horse, the audience can appreciate the artistry and finesse involved in this unique equestrian discipline.</p>
<h3>Bareback Riding Equipment and Gear: What You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Though bareback riding primarily involves the rider and the horse, specific equipment and gear are crucial for ensuring a safe and comfortable experience. Items such as bareback pads, riding boots, and safety helmets play a vital role in providing stability, protection, and support during the ride.</p>
<h3>Common Challenges Faced by Bareback Riders and How to Overcome Them</h3>
<p>Bareback riding presents a set of challenges that riders must navigate skillfully. Issues such as maintaining balance, responding to sudden movements, and preventing fatigue require dedication, perseverance, and a deep understanding of the horse&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<h3>Bareback Riding and Its Impacts on Horse Health: What You Need to Consider</h3>
<p>While bareback riding fosters a strong bond between the rider and the horse, it is essential to consider the potential impacts on the horse&#8217;s health. Ensuring proper warm-up and cool-down routines, using suitable equipment, and monitoring the horse&#8217;s well-being are crucial for maintaining its physical and mental health.</p>
<h3>Tips for Beginners: Getting Started with Bareback Riding</h3>
<p>For those intrigued by the art of bareback riding, starting with the basics and seeking guidance from experienced riders and trainers is essential. Emphasizing safety, building core strength, and establishing trust with the horse are fundamental steps for beginners embarking on their bareback riding journey.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
