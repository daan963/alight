										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is the season-ending championship event for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association and is widely acknowledged to be the world’s premier rodeo. Held every December since 1985 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, the Wrangler NFR is ProRodeo’s richest and most prestigious rodeo, and it showcases the very best cowboys, barrel racers and livestock in the world.</p>
<h2>2019 WNFR Team Roping Heelers Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Hunter Koch</strong>: Hunter Koch – Vernon, Texas ($84,307) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-611 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hunter-Koch.jpg" alt="Hunter Koch – Vernon, Texas ($84,307) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hunter-Koch.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hunter-Koch-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>A year ago, Hunter Koch (pronounced Cook) was just finishing up his first year as a heeler in the PRCA.</p>
<p>He spent a good part of that year roping with Billy Bob Brown, a fellow Texan and when it was all said and done, he finished the year in 39th place and won $24,202.</p>
<p>Now, he had earned a national title, has more than tripled his earnings and is headed to his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He will heel for Matt Sherwood who he has been roping with since the Reno Rodeo. They won a bunch of money at Canadian Rodeos and were one of 12 teams that qualified for the Canadian Finals Rodeo (CFR). They were in fourth place.</p>

<p>Fall is Travis Graves’ favorite time of the year. It’s a time when he gets to be at his home in Texas, temperatures are cooler, and he gets to prepare for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>Whether he’s been in Oklahoma where he grew up or in Texas, he has always enjoyed the fall. For the 11 years, fall has included plans to spend the first two weeks of December in Las Vegas for the NFR.</p>
<p>He competed at his first NFR in 2008 with Turtle Powell. Then he missed a year, was back in 2010 and has been there every year since. Travis will enter this year’s competition in fifth place with $103,165 in regular season earnings. Most of that was earned with Clay Tryan.</p>

<p>Brady Minor has had to find room in his trailer for a pony this year and is getting an idea of what his grandparents did to help he and brother Riley in their pursuit of team roping excellence.</p>
<p>That excellence in the arena will see Brady competing at his 11th Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He’ll start the competition with $97,648 earned during the regular season. He did that roping with his younger brother Riley.</p>

<p>If the family that rodeos together stays together, Cole Davison is in for quite a ride.</p>
<p>A year ago, Cole made his debut appearance at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo with fellow Texan Tyler Wade. They won $63,308 even though their partnership just started.</p>
<p>In 2018, Cole’s primary partner, Kolton Schmidt, wasn’t among the top 15 headers at the end of the regular season. Cole finished in 13th place.</p>
<p>This year, he found himself in a similar situation when Levi Simpson, the 2016 world champion header finished in 24th. Cole will start this year’s NFR in 14th place with $71,909 in regular season earnings. And, he will be roping again with Tyler Wade.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Levi Simpson</strong><br />
• Won the Livingston (Mont.) Roundup<br />
• Won the Bruce (Alberta) Stampede<br />

<p>Paul Eaves proved this year that he is not one and done.</p>
<p>The reigning world champion heeler had a partner change in January, a new baby in April, a super busy summer and is headed back to Las Vegas to defend his title. He will be roping at his eighth consecutive Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>Most of Paul’s regular-season earnings came with Luke Brown doing the heading. He’ll start the competition in ninth place with $89,447 and at the NFR his partnership with Luke will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />

<p><strong>Joseph Harrison</strong>: Joseph Harrison – Overbrook, Okla. ($98,278) 3-time WNFR qualifer</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-616 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Joseph-Harrison.jpg" alt="Joseph Harrison – Overbrook, Okla.

<p>Joseph Harrison grew up at Roff, Oklahoma amid a family of ropers. His father, grandfather and uncle roped. Well, pretty much everyone in his family roped, so he started roping too.</p>
<p>As a teenager, he was looking to improve and decided if he was really going to excel in the rodeo arena, he needed to up his horsemanship. So at 15 and for the next several years he would spend every summer vacation, every spring break and every chance he got with Bobby Lewis, renown Quarter Horse breeder and trainer.</p>
<p>Did it up Joseph’s game? Without a doubt. He joined the PRCA in 2007, the first of two years that he qualified for the College National Finals Rodeo. He continued to work for Bobby and was showing horses.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Chad Masters</strong><br />

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-617 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tyler-Worley.jpg" alt="Tyler Worley – Berryville, Ark.

<p>Brittany Worley is getting to have a Wrangler National Finals Rodeo experience that is very rare.</p>
<p>As a child, she got to see her father ride around the Thomas and Mack Arena for the grand entry carrying the Arkansas flag. Now that her husband, Tyler Worley has qualified and is the only resident from Arkansas in this year’s field, she will get to see him do the same.</p>
<p>Tyler Worley finished the regular season in 15th place in the heeling category of the team roping. He will start the NFR with $71,190, He edged out Billy Jack Saebens by just over $2,200 for the final spot. The first call he got was Billy Jack calling to congratulate him. Tyler was still having a hard time believing that it was true.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights</strong><br />
• Won the West of the Pecos (Texas) Rodeo with Jeff Flenniken</p>
<p><strong>Junior Nogueira</strong>: Junior Nogueira – Presidente Prude, Brazil ($115,775) 6-time WNFR qualifier 2016 All-Around World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-618 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Junior-Nogueira.jpg" alt="Junior Nogueira: Junior Nogueira – Presidente Prude, Brazil ($115,775) 6-time WNFR qualifier 2016 All-Around World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Junior-Nogueira.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Junior-Nogueira-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>It would be easy to think that Junior Nogueira has the world by the tail, or maybe two feet. The best heeler in the PRCA during the 2019 regular season is known for his signature pull back move in the arena when he’s done his job well.</p>
<p>That has transferred to social media where he now hashtags posts with #pullbackforJesus. It now means so much more to Junior than a successful team roping run who told the Team Roping Journal that he gets his confidence and strength from God.</p>
<p>Junior started roping as a toddler in his native country of Brazil. Both of his parents roped. When he was five, his father was roping calves, had a heart attack and died.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights- partner Kaleb Driggers</strong><br />

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-619 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wesley-Thorp.jpg" alt="Wesley Thorp – Throckmorton, Texas ($87,296) 4-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wesley-Thorp.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wesley-Thorp-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>In five years as a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Wesley Thorp has racked up over half a million dollars in earnings and qualified for four Wrangler National Finals Rodeos. Not bad for a ranch kid from Throckmorton, Texas.</p>
<p>He also has two National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association titles to his credit and has won a slew of jackpots. Wesley’s first trip to Las Vegas came with another young roper, Zac Small. They were both still in college. Zac had been accepted to veterinarian school, so he had to focus on his education after that.</p>
<p>Then Wesley started roping with Cody Snow, the 2015 heading rookie of the year. That partnership has stayed strong and they are headed to their third NFR together. They won $108,788 at last year’s NFR and Wesley finished the season in fourth place.</p>

<p><strong>Jade Corkill</strong>: Jade Corkill – Fallon, Nev. ($108,638) 10-time WNFR qualifier 3-time World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-620 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jade-Corkill.jpg" alt="Jade Corkill – Fallon, Nev.

<p>After nine Wrangler National finals Rodeo qualifications, Jade Corkill had fallen out of love with rodeo and roping.</p>
<p>He told his team roping partner, Clay Tryan, after the 2018 winter rodeos that he should start heading for someone else. Jade went home, spent time with his wife, Haley, and two boys, Colby, eight and Kelton, five. His heart wasn’t in practicing or the rodeo grind anymore.</p>
<p>They spent the summer in Nevada at his parent’s place. He entered the Bob Feist Invitational and Spicer Gripp Memorial ropings. He didn’t do any good, confirming his decision to get off the rodeo trail. He finished the 2018 season in 78th place.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan Motes</strong>: Ryan Motes – Weatherford, Texas ($109,166) 5-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-621 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryan-Motes.jpg" alt="Ryan Motes: Ryan Motes – Weatherford, Texas ($109,166) 5-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryan-Motes.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryan-Motes-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Ryan Motes joined the PRCA in 2001, qualified for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 2001 and is headed back to Las Vegas again this year in second place.</p>
<p>He’s had the best regular season of his rodeo career earning $109,166 before he ever rides into the Thomas and Mack Center. His father, David Motes, roped to a world title (heading) in Oklahoma City with Ryan’s uncle, Dennis Motes. David qualified for the NFR a total of 22 times.</p>
<p>Ryan’s first appearance in the Thomas and Mack arena was long before he ever competed there. In 1989, four years after the event moved to Las Vegas. The openings were being coordinated by the Flying U Rodeo Company and one of them centered around rodeo kids. Ryan Motes was one of those kids and at nine years old, he rode his horse into the arena like a champ.</p>

<p><strong>Chase Tryan</strong>: Chase Tryan – Helena, Mont. ($86,345) 3-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-622 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Chase-Tryan.jpg" alt="Chase Tryan – Helena, Mont.

<p>A year ago, Chase Tryan had roped with four different partners to get him to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>One of those was Brenten Hall, who he has roped with all year and this year they both qualified for rodeo’s championships. It’s Chase’s third trip to the NFR and Brenten’s first.</p>
<p>Chase had faith in Brenten’s ability from the beginning. They set a goal of Brenten winning Rookie of the Year and hoping to get to Vegas, but he didn’t get to rope at the big winter rodeos and fell short.</p>
<p>He did, however, continue to rope with Chase and help him make it to his second NFR. Chase roped with Bubba Buckaloo in Las Vegas last year. They won $106,814 in the Thomas and Mack Center and Chase finished the season in sixth place.</p>

<p>If Caleb Anderson needs some motivation to rope, he can always go home to North Carolina and work. His family is involved in the logging industry and he has been a fifth-generation logger.</p>
<p>Now he is one of the best heelers in the PRCA and is headed to his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. It’s been quite a journey for the former student at New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs. He joined the PRCA in 2010 and was also competing in the International Professional Rodeo Association where he won championships from 2013 -2015.</p>
<p>His good friend Cory Kidd V, also from North Carolina told Caleb he should come rope for a whole year. They did that together last year. Caleb finished in 32nd place.</p>

<p>Jake Long has had one of the best regular seasons of his career roping behind several great headers. He will enter his ninth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in fourth place with $106,896 in regular season earnings.</p>
<p>He started off the year with wins at the National Western Stock Show Rodeo in Denver and the RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo in Kissimmee, Florida with Clay Smith. Then in June he started roping with Dustin Egusquiza. He finished up the season with Dustin who ended up 16th in the world standings. He and Dustin have already started earning checks in the 2020 season.</p>
<p>When Jake ropes at this year’s NFR, he will be heeling for three-time world champion Clay Tryan. He and Clay won $30,000 each at a jackpot in North Dakota in June and are looking forward to running 10 steers in Vegas.</p>

<p>When Kyle Lockett rides into the Thomas and Mack Center for the 2019 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, he will be the oldest team roping heeler there at 42.</p>
<p>But that’s only part of what makes his story so remarkable. This is Kyle’s eighth qualification for rodeo’s championship, but the first in 15 years. He joined the PRCA in 1997, won the rookie title in the heeling and qualified for his first NFR. He was there again in 1998.</p>
<p>He was there again in the at the beginning of the next century and in 2002 he and partner Wade Wheatley finished as reserve world champions. They had roped together growing up and Kyle finished his rodeo career with Wade in 2005, or so he though.</p>

<h3>How does a breakaway rope work?</h3>
<p>The rope is tied to the saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the timer. In conjunction with the Wrangler® National Finals Rodeo (NFR) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, women ropers will compete for the 2020 world championship: The <a href="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/national-finals-breakaway-roping-live-stream-how-to-watch/">Wrangler® National Finals Breakaway Roping</a> (NFBR) and a $200,000 purse at this three-day event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is the season-ending championship event for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association and is widely acknowledged to be the world’s premier rodeo. Held every December since 1985 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, the Wrangler NFR is ProRodeo’s richest and most prestigious rodeo, and it showcases the very best cowboys, barrel racers and livestock in the world.</p>
<h2>2019 WNFR Team Roping Headers Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Riley Minor</strong>: Riley Minor – Ellensburg, Wash. ($97,649) 10-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-587 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Riley-Minor.jpg" alt="Riley Minor – Ellensburg, Wash.

<p>There have been a lot of consistency’s in Riley Minor’s life. And there have been things that he has been consistent at. One of those is team roping and that has him headed to his 10th Wrangler National Finals Rodeo roping with his older brother.</p>
<p>Every time that Riley has nodded his head to call for a steer in the Thomas and Mack Center, his older brother Brady has been to his right waiting to rope two legs. Riley has consistently roped horns and this year that has led to $97,649 in regular season earnings. He will start the NFR in sixth place. His four-legged partner has added to that consistency over the last several years.</p>

<p>Erich spent most of the 2019 season roping with the PRCA Heeling Rookie of the Year who finished the season in 17th place. Paden will be in Las Vegas to get his award. Erich finished the regular season with $73,999 in earnings and will start the NFR in 13th place.</p>
<p>He and Paden had a good Cowboy Christmas run winning the rodeo at St. Paul, Oregon and tying for first at what Erich considers his hometown rodeo in Window Rock, Arizona. The win was really special for Paden as it was the first buckle that he has won at a rodeo. Erich had won the rodeo in 2015 and even though he has a gold buckle, the one from St. Paul is what he sports most of the time. He told Paden it was his lucky buckle. Now thanks to Erich’s heading, Paden has one of his own and Erich has two lucky buckles.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-589 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clay-Smith.jpg" alt="Clay Smith – Broken Bow, Okla.

<p>A year ago, Clay Smith missed his first steer at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. What could have dashed his hopes for a world title reminded him to treat the NFR like 10 separate rodeos.</p>
<p>He did just that, went on to place in seven of the rounds winning rounds two and five and leaving Las Vegas as the new world champion header. It was his fourth qualification for rodeo’s championships and each of those times had been with heeler Paul Eaves, who won the world in the heeling.</p>
<p>This year has been a year of transition for the man from Broken Bow, Oklahoma. He started roping with Jake Long. They won the National Western Stock Show Rodeo in Denver in January and the RAM National Circuit Finals in March.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-590 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ty-Blasingame.jpg" alt="Ty Blasingame – Casper, Wyo.

<p>Sometimes the unexpected works out. It sure did for Ty Blasingame this year. Ty is headed back to the NFR after a nine-year absence.</p>
<p>He was there in 2010 with Cody Hintz finishing the season in 14th place. Finding head horses, getting married and having daughters all added challenges to Ty’s quest to get back to Vegas. He came close finishing in the top 25 three more years. Then to support his family he started driving truck. He bought more trucks and had others working for him, but the desire to get back to roping was growing. Ty had been living in Ramah, Colorado. After going through a divorce, he moved to Casper, Wyoming.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights</strong><br />
• Won RodeoHouston (Texas), with Kyle Lockett<br />

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-591 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clay-Tryan.jpg" alt="Clay Tryan – Billings, Mont.

<p>There’s very little in the world of team roping that Clay Tryan has yet to accomplish, yet he still finds the drive and passion to load up horses, get in a truck and drive to the next rodeo or jackpot.</p>
<p>He has been a member of the PRCA for 22 years and has won nearly every major rodeo on the circuit. The Reno (Nevada) Rodeo is still on his bucket list. When he nods his head to call for a steer at the first performance of this year’s Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, it will be the 151st time he has done that.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Travis Graves</strong><br />

<p>Brenten Hall has the distinction of being one of two first-time Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualifiers in the heading, is the youngest of this year’s team ropers and he predicted his future when he was seven years old.</p>
<p>Brenten, who grew up in Jay, Oklahoma with a family of ropers turned 20 last June. He will enter his first NFR in ninth place with $88,927 in regular-season earnings. His parents roped with Travis Graves when he was just starting. They kept busy with roping, raising cattle and kids.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, when Cody Snow was still a teenager, he made an investment that has had a very positive influence in his life.</p>
<p>That was when he purchased a four-year-old mare, Ima Fresnos Dee, that has been partially responsible for his four trips to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He calls the mare Annie and he is the only person that has ever roped on her.</p>

<p>Matt Sherwood told Chelsea Schaeffer on the Team Roping Journal’s podcast “The Score” that this season had been a big rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>Looking at his statistics, his career could be likened to a rollercoaster as well. Matt, from Pima, Arizona is headed to his sixth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 11th place with $76,204 won during the regular season.</p>

<p>It would have been hard to imagine the career that was ahead of Kaleb Driggers when he first started roping as a four-year-old.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later, Kaleb is headed to his eighth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He has won over $1.5 million in the PRCA alone, many major rodeo titles, and been the reserve world champion four times.</p>
<p>Three of those have been with his current partner, Junior Nogueira, and they have been the last three years. Kaleb enters the 2019 NFR in second place with $118,455.</p>

<p>If Chad Masters is handing out advice to young people, he tells them to do something that he didn’t do, go to college and get an education.</p>
<p>The two-time world champion doesn’t have many regrets, but he has said that if he would have gone to college and gained maturity before starting on his journey to becoming one of the world’s best ropers, that journey might not have had so many twists and turns.</p>
<p>The Cedar Hill, Tennessee resident joined the PRCA in 2001 and two years later was heading at his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. In 2006 he won his first NFR average championship and finished the year as the reserve world champion.</p>

<p>On Oct. 1st when the 2019 regular rodeo season was officially over, Tate Kirchenschlager posted on his Facebook wall, “What an unforgettable year it has been – I qualified for my first NFR.”</p>
<p>When Tate starts this year’s Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 12th place with $75,738 in earnings. Throughout the year he has roped with five different partners, and two of them got him big wins that were critical to his qualification.</p>
<p>Last year he finished 47th in the world standings. That got him into San Antonio where he roped with the reigning team roping rookie, Ross Ashford for the first time. They got the W there and collected $25,750. Just like that, the eight-year-member of the PRCA was at the top of the world standings.</p>

<p>Luke Brown is making some room on the trophy wall of his barn. When he walks in there, he has a nice reminder of the success that he has had as a PRCA team roping header.</p>
<p>He has qualified for his 12th consecutive Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 10th place with $84,939 earned during the regular season. His previous 11 back numbers are all framed and hung on the wall. And while he lives in Texas now, South Carolina will always be home. He’ll be proud to carry the “Palmetto State” flag during the grand entry for 10 nights in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights</strong><br />

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-600 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tyler-Wade.jpg" alt="Tyler Wade: Tyler Wade – Terrell, Texas ($73,394) 3-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tyler-Wade.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tyler-Wade-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>With three Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualifications to his credit, it’s going to be a smarter Tyler Wade that rides into the roping box in the Thomas and Mack Center this year.</p>
<p>Tyler learned a lot at his first two qualifications. The first was in 2016 with Dakota Kirchenschlager. He missed it in 2017 finishing the season in 28th. Then he made it back again in 2018.</p>
<p>The first year he was there he didn’t really know what to expect and no matter what anyone told him, experiencing it for himself was a different reality. He saw what other ropers did to prepare and tried to mimic that. It wasn’t the best plan. He and Dakota placed in four rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Billie Jack Saebens</strong><br />

<p>Coleman Proctor knows what it is like to be on the bubble for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He knows all about near misses as well after finishing last year in 18th place.</p>
<p>Now he knows what it is like to qualify for rodeo’s championships near the top of the list and to be able to pick and choose which fall rodeos he wants to compete at. That happened this year thanks in part to a big win he and partner Ryan Motes had at RFD-TV’s The American last March.</p>
<p>That $50,000 that he won there had him in second place in the world standings the first of April with over $90,000 in earnings. That is a position he had never been in before. He continued picking up checks with Ryan and other partners to the tune of $104,318 earned in the regular season.</p>

• Co-champion at the Eureka (Kan.) Pro Rodeo, with Brye Crites<br />
• Won Tulsa (Okla.) State Fair PRCA Rodeo, with Joseph Harrison</p>
<h3>How does a breakaway rope work?</h3>
<p>The rope is tied to the saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the timer. In conjunction with the Wrangler® National Finals Rodeo (NFR) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, women ropers will compete for the 2020 world championship: The <a href="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/national-finals-breakaway-roping-live-stream-how-to-watch/">Wrangler® NFBR</a> and a $200,000 purse at this three-day event.</p>

<p>Will Lummus quickly became one of the most popular steer wrestlers at the 2018 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>It was his first appearance and right out of the gate, the likeable Mississippian was getting checks. In fact, he won round five and including that round, got checks in seven out of the first eight rounds.</p>
<p>He had entered in fifth place. His success in the Thomas and Mack arena had him on pace to win a world title. Then disaster struck in the ninth round. A no-time took him out of the average and he finished the season in third place.</p>
<p>Disappointment didn’t last long. He still left Las Vegas with $132,551 and it wasn’t long until he was geared up for the 2019 season. After the winter rodeos he had moved into the top 15 in the world standings. He continued to climb through the summer.</p>

<p>Nevada native Dakota Eldridge will be making the trip south from his hometown of Elko to Las Vegas to compete at his sixth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. He qualified for the WNFR in steer wrestling for five years in a row, from 2013 to 2017.</p>
<p>Last year he started out to be his best year yet. He won the San Antonio Stock Show Rodeo and kept winning until July. That’s when he tore up his knee at Cheyenne Frontier Days. He missed the rest of the season and finished the year 24th in the world standings.</p>
<p>Dakota’s comeback was slower than what he had hoped for. He didn’t crack the Top 15 until late April when he won more than $5,100 at Clovis, California. Other wins this season included Greeley, Colorado; Las Vegas Days, Nevada; Ramona and Norco, California; Lynden, Washington, and Dodge City, Kansas. His combined winnings between Greeley (July 3) and Dodge City (August 4) were over $18,000. He’ll start the 2019 NFR in 11th place with $81,103 in regular season earnings.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for momentum. Just ask Tyler Waguespack.</p>
<p>He’s had momentum on his side and been able to use it to his advantage to qualify for five-consecutive Wrangler National Finals. He left Las Vegas on two of those occasions with the gold buckle awarded to world champions.</p>

<p>When Tyler Pearson backed into the timed-event box at the 2018 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, he was wearing the world champion steer wrestling buckle and riding the best horse in the PRCA.</p>
<p>But no matter what happened inside the arena in the Thomas and Mack Center, Tyler and Kyle Irwin, “Scooter’s” owners, their sponsors and fans had already made a commitment outside of the arena that would change lives.</p>
<p><strong>Professional</strong><br />
<strong>2019 Highlights</strong><br />
• Won the Ram National Circuit Finals Rodeo (Kissimmee, Fla.)<br />
• Won the Omaha (Neb.) River City Rodeo</p>
<p><strong>Stetson Jorgensen</strong>: Stetson Jorgensen – Blackfoot, Idaho ($90,220) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>

<p>Stetson Jorgensen joined the PRCA in 2015 and in the first three years of his membership earned $52,695. The bulk of that was in 2018 as he was working to set himself up for the 2019 season.</p>
<p>The Blackfoot, Idaho resident wanted to be among the top 50 in the world to qualify for the winter building rodeos. He finished 38th in the world standings in 2018 with $37,601. This year he set out to qualify for his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>

<p><strong>Hunter Cure</strong>: Hunter Cure – Holliday, Texas ($104,568) 5-time WNFR qualifier 2013 &amp; 2015 World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-581 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/15.jpg" alt="Hunter Cure – Holliday, Texas ($104,568) 5-time WNFR qualifier 2013 &amp; 2015 World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/15.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/15-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>A big part of Hunter Cure’s success this year can be attributed to one of the most important equine partners that he has ever had.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2015, Cure rode a steer wrestling horse he calls Charlie to world championships. He made his first trip to Las Vegas to compete at rodeo’s championships in 2009. He was there also in 2018 and is making his fifth trip this year.</p>
<p>In 2016 Charlie cut his foot. That injury was not just threatening Charlie’s career, it nearly took his life. The Cures did everything they could just to keep him comfortable and let him live out his days in the luxury of a pasture.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wrangler NFR is the season-ending championship event for the PRCA and the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association and is widely acknowledged to be the world’s premier rodeo. Held every December since 1985 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, the Wrangler NFR is ProRodeo’s richest and most prestigious rodeo, and it showcases the very best cowboys, barrel racers and livestock in the world.</p>
<h2>2019 WNFR Bareback Riders Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Jake Brown</strong>: Jake Brown – Cleveland, Texas ($95,068) 5-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-536 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jake-Brown.jpg" alt="Jake Brown – Cleveland, Texas ($95,068) 5-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jake-Brown.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jake-Brown-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Jake has always wanted to be cowboy and one of the first goals he ever set was to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>He enters his fifth NFR in ninth place with $95,048 in regular season earnings. The born and bred Texan first accomplished that goal in 2015 and hasn’t missed one since. His father, Paul Brown is a college rodeo coach. He has two older sisters that competed at play days and the family was nearly always at a rodeo or practicing for rodeos.</p>
<p><strong>Tim O’Connell</strong>: Tim O’Connell – Zwingle, Iowa ($113,168) 6-time WNFR qualifier 3-time World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-537 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-OConnell.jpg" alt="Tim O’Connell – Zwingle, Iowa ($113,168) 6-time WNFR qualifier 3-time World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-OConnell.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-OConnell-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Three years in a row Tim O’Connell entered the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in first place and left with a world title. But in 2018, he also left with an injury.</p>
<p>He scored 87-points on J Bar J’s bucking horse All Pink in the tenth round, but that came at a cost. He suffered a torn rotator cuff and torn labrum. While he didn’t think the injury was that bad at first, an MRI when he returned home showed the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Dr. Tandy Freeman of the Justin Sportsmedicine Team recommended surgery which kept Tim out of action for six months. The upside of the forced inaction was Tim had more time to spend with his wife Sami and their son Hazen who turned one in March.</p>
<blockquote><p>I enjoyed the six months off,” he said. “God blessed me with the time to spend with my wife and son, and it lit my fire to ride bucking horses again.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Trenten Montero</strong>: Trenten Montero – Winnemucca, Nev. ($80,757) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-538 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trenton-Montero.jpg" alt="Trenten Montero – Winnemucca, Nev. ($80,757) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trenton-Montero.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trenton-Montero-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>If Trenton Montero has any regrets about his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualification, it’s that he won’t be able to participate in the grand entry.</p>
<p>There is nothing this ranch-raised cowboy would rather do than ride behind the Nevada flag as one of this year’s Wrangler National Finals Rodeo contestants, except get on a bucking horse and ride for a world championship. That is exactly what he is going to do and because bareback riding is the first event, those contestants don’t participate in the grand entry.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Broussard</strong>: Taylor Broussard – Estherwood, La. ($79,271) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-539 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Taylor-Broussard.jpg" alt="Taylor Broussard – Estherwood, La. ($79,271) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Taylor-Broussard.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Taylor-Broussard-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>When a lot of rodeo contestants qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, someone plans a celebration for them.</p>
<p>Taylor Broussard from Estherwood, Louisiana is having his own party on Facebook. Broussard’s family owns Acadia Crawfish Company, a gourmet line of spices and foods that reflects his Louisiana bayou heritage. When it was official, and he could announce that he got the 15th spot and was headed to compete on rodeo’s biggest stage he celebrated by giving away a starter kit to have the world’s best crawfish boil.</p>
<p>While he is giving others the opportunity to have a celebration, he and his wife Alishea and their families are doing a lot of celebrating as well. Taylor joined the PRCA in 2011. When he’s not rodeoing, he works at the family business. After finishing in the top 40 last year, he felt like he could compete with the best and had the confidence that he could be among the top 15 that ride for the gold buckle.</p>
<p><strong>Tilden Hooper</strong>: Tilden Hooper – Carthage, Texas ($137,559) 6-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-540 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tilden-Hooper.jpg" alt="Tilden Hooper – Carthage, Texas ($137,559) 6-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tilden-Hooper.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tilden-Hooper-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>When Tilden Hooper won the bareback riding at the College National Finals Rodeo and the PRCA Rookie of the Year in 2007, everyone saw a bright future for the talented athlete.</p>
<p>He qualified for his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 2008. Tilden finished that year 15th in the world standings. The next year he qualified again in 14th place.</p>
<p>In 2010, he tied for the world-record score when he rode Classic Pro Rodeo’s Big Tex for 94 points. But he missed the NFR.</p>
<p>A trip back to Las Vegas came in 2011 and again in 2014, when he finished the year in 11th place both times.</p>
<p><strong>Clint Laye</strong>: Clint Laye – Cadogan, Alberta ($107,954) 2-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-541 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clint-Laye.jpg" alt="Clint Laye – Cadogan, Alberta ($107,954) 2-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clint-Laye.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clint-Laye-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Clint Laye is returning to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo after a three-year absence. The Canadian bareback rider qualified for his first trip to the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in 2015, finished 10th in the world standings and placed in four of the 10 rounds.</p>
<p>Injuries kept him out of action for most of 2016, he finished in the Top 50 in 2017 and just missed returning to the WNFR last year when he finished 17th. He starts this year’s competition in eighth place with $107,954 in regular season earnings.</p>
<p>He started 2019 with a bang, winning the National Western Stock Show &amp; Rodeo in Denver in January. Other big wins included the California Rodeo in Salinas; Union, Oregon; Jerome, Idaho; Moses Lake, Washington; and Mona, Utah, the last weekend of the regular rodeo season.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Breuer</strong>: Ty Breuer – Mandan, N.D. ($88,699) 5–time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-542 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ty-Breuer.jpg" alt="Ty Breuer – Mandan, N.D. ($88,699) 5–time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ty-Breuer.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ty-Breuer-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Ty Breuer had the best winter of his nine years as a PRCA bareback rider this year.</p>
<p>The Mandan, North Dakota resident won the <a href="https://wranglernetwork.com/events/fwssr/">Fort Worth Stock Show &amp; Rodeo</a>, then the Fiesta De Las Vaqueros Rodeo in Tucson, Arizona. He also got nearly $10,000 out of the <a href="https://wranglernetwork.com/events/san-antonio-stock-show-and-rodeo/">San Antonio Stock Show Rodeo</a>.</p>
<p>He continued winning and by the first of April had worked his way to third place in the world standings. Then things started to slow down. After the Fourth of July he was sixth with $86,113. He only added $2,586 through the rest of the season qualifying for his fifth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 12th place with $88,699.</p>
<p><strong>Caleb Bennett</strong>: Caleb Bennett – Corvallis, Mont. ($110,973) 8-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-543 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Caleb-Bennett.jpg" alt="Caleb Bennett – Corvallis, Mont. ($110,973) 8-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Caleb-Bennett.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Caleb-Bennett-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Caleb Bennett had high hopes for a gold buckle last year. He came to Las Vegas ranked 2nd, his best regular season finish in more than a decade of membership in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.</p>
<p>He won one round at the 2018 WNFR and placed in three others – a respectable showing – but five other cowboys won enough in the 10 rounds to pass him. He finished the year ranked sixth in the world.</p>
<p>This year he starts rodeo’s championships in seventh with $110,973 earned in during the regular season. He kicked off 2019 with big wins in Texas at San Angelo and Austin, where he won first for the second year in a row. Other big wins came at the 100th anniversary Cody (Wyoming) Stampede over July 4 and at several Canadian rodeos.</p>
<p><strong>Austin Foss</strong>: Austin Foss – Terrebonne, Ore. ($92,895) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-544 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Austin-Foss.jpg" alt="Austin Foss – Terrebonne, Ore. ($92,895) 4-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Austin-Foss.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Austin-Foss-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>A bareback riding glove that gets wedged into the handle of a rigging is much more than a tool for Austin Foss of Terrebonne, Oregon.</p>
<p>The four-time Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualifier customizes those gloves for his fellow competitors and uses his own glove to keep track of his rides and remind him to keep improving. Each time he is more than 80 points on a ride, he stamps an eight on his glove. He pulled out some old gloves and did some calculating. The glove he rode with in 2012 had about 20 of the eights on it. The next year it was 26. During this year’s regular season, he has been 80 points or better a total of 45 times and even got to put a nine on his glove for a ride that topped 90 this year.</p>
<p>That success during the regular season has Austin headed to the NFR in 11th place with $92,895. A native Oregonian, Austin won the state title in high school twice. He went on to Blue Mountain Community College in Pendleton and finished fifth at the College National Finals Rodeo in 2012, the same year he won the PRCA Rookie-of-the-Year title.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Dent</strong>: Steven Dent – Mullen, Neb. ($93,799) 10-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-545 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Steven-Dent.jpg" alt="Steven Dent – Mullen, Neb. ($93,799) 10-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Steven-Dent.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Steven-Dent-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Growing up in the sandhills of Nebraska, there were three things Steven Dent learned a lot about, athletics, rodeo and ranching. He has been successful at all three and 2019 marks his tenth trip to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>When he was a junior in high school,l he helped his eight-man football team win a state championship and led the state in rushing with 2,488 yards. The next year, he was a state wrestling champion.</p>
<p>All the while, he was learning about rodeo from his father who competed in the PRCA. His parents made their living ranching and he was taking that all in as well. Football scholarships held little interest to the high school athlete, but an offer to rodeo with world champion saddle bronc rider Tom Reeves at Ranger College in Texas was very appealing.</p>
<p>Steven also competes in saddle bronc riding as well as bareback riding. In fact, he finished the 2019 regular season ranked fifth in the all-around world championship standings and won the collegiate all-around title in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Clayton Biglow</strong>: Clayton Biglow – Clements, Calif. ($181,952) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-546 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clayton-Biglow.jpg" alt="Clayton Biglow – Clements, Calif.

<p>After the best season of his rodeo career, Clayton Biglow is headed to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo for the fourth consecutive year – and this time he’s the frontrunner.</p>
<p>He racked up nearly $182,000 in regular-season earnings, including over $9,000 in the final month of the season to move him $5,741 ahead of four-time world champion Kaycee Feild.</p>
<p>Clayton has been among the top seven bareback riders in the world since 2016, just three years removed from winning the National High School Rodeo Association champion bareback rider and reserve all-around cowboy.</p>
<p>After his first NFR qualification in 2016, he finished the season in seventh place. In 2017, he was fifth and in 2018 he finished fourth. With that constant improvement, this year he is poised for a serious bid for a world championship.</p>
<p><strong>Kaycee Feild</strong>: Kaycee Feild – Spanish Fork, Utah ($176,205) 10-time WNFR qualifier 4-time World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-547 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kaycee-Feild.jpg" alt="Kaycee Feild – Spanish Fork, Utah ($176,205) 10-time WNFR qualifier 4-time World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kaycee-Feild.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kaycee-Feild-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>The path to his tenth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo has been a roller-coaster of ups and downs for four-time world champion bareback rider Kaycee Feild.</p>
<p>After finishing seventh at the end of 2018, Feild didn’t have an exceptional early season in 2019. By mid-February he was ranked 10th in the world championship standings.</p>
<p>Then came March. He started the month winning second place and $26,000 at The American in Arlington, Texas. Then he headed to one of his favorite rodeos – Rodeo Houston. There he won his fifth title in eight years and added more than $56,000 to his season earnings and passing the $100,000 mark. He finished the month by staying in Texas and winning $12,000 at Rodeo Austin and held the number one position with just under $116,000.</p>
<p><strong>Richmond Champion</strong>: Richmond Champion – The Woodlands, Texas ($130,829) 5-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-548 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richmond-Champion.jpg" alt="Richmond Champion – The Woodlands, Texas ($130,829) 5-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richmond-Champion.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richmond-Champion-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>With parents that jobs that required frequent moves, Richmond Champion didn’t find his way to the rodeo arena until he was a teenager and had moved to Texas. The first-generation cowboy has truly found his passion and has qualified for his fifth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in the bareback riding.</p>
<p>His mother competed in equestrian events in high school and had a love for horses that she passed on. The family is super competitive with everything they do and when Richmond’s older brother Doug was riding bareback horses, it wasn’t long until they both were getting on. Richmond had been riding bulls but said “I wasn’t very good at it,” so the transition to bareback was an easy decision.</p>
<p>Wanting to be the best he knew he needed to learn so he went to three bareback riding schools in six months. It paid off. He won the Texas High School Rodeo title, competed at the National High School Finals Rodeo and got a chance to further his education at Tarleton State University.</p>
<p><strong>Orin Larsen</strong>: Orin Larsen – Inglis, Manitoba ($173,442) 5-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-549 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Orin-Larsen.jpg" alt="Orin Larsen – Inglis, Manitoba ($173,442) 5-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Orin-Larsen.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Orin-Larsen-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Orin Larsen is making a habit of qualifying for both the Canadian Finals Rodeo (CFR) and the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. This is the fourth year in a row that he will compete at Canada’s championship rodeo in October and then head to Las Vegas for the WNFR in December.</p>
<p>The first year he qualified for the NFR was in 2015. But the native Canadian missed the CFR that year.</p>
<p>Orin’s first NFR qualification was special for the family as his older brother Tyrell competed in the saddle bronc riding. They were the first contestants from Manitoba to compete for rodeo’s championships.</p>
<p>They have made a lot of family memories. At last year’s CFR, Orin competed in bareback riding, Tyrell in saddle bronc riding and their youngest brother Kane qualified in the bull riding.</p>
<p><strong>Tanner Aus</strong>: Tanner Aus – Granite Falls, Minn. ($81,595) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-550 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tanner-Aus.jpg" alt="Tanner Aus – Granite Falls, Minn. ($81,595) 4-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tanner-Aus.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tanner-Aus-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Rodeo fans would be hard pressed to find a cowboy that is more humble than Tanner Aus from Granite Falls, Minnesota.</p>
<p>He has won a lot of big rodeos, qualified for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo four times and is on track to cross the $1 million mark. In fact, even though he is entering the NFR in 13th place with $81,595 he could cross that milestone in Las Vegas in December.</p>
<p>Each of the three previous years that he has been there, he has shared or won at least one round and placed in multiple rounds. He has career earnings of nearly $900,000 so it’s a pretty safe bet that he will accomplish that goal at this year’s NFR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wrangler NFR is the season-ending championship event for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association and is widely acknowledged to be the world’s premier rodeo. Held every December since 1985 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, the Wrangler NFR is ProRodeo’s richest and most prestigious rodeo, and it showcases the very best cowboys, barrel racers and livestock in the world.</p>
<h2>2019 WNFR Barrel Racers Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Jennifer Sharp</strong>: Jennifer Sharp – Richards, Texas ($91,754) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-510 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jennifer-Sharp.jpg" alt="Jennifer Sharp – Richards, Texas ($91,754) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jennifer-Sharp.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jennifer-Sharp-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Jennifer Sharp started the 2019 season with a bang, winning second at Odessa, Texas, and then taking the championship at the National Western Stock Show &amp; Rodeo in Denver in January. Riding Six French Smooches “Smooch”, she won nearly $12,000. Smooch, a six-year-old palomino mare is owned by Terri Lamp of Cat Springs, Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Hailey Kinsel</strong>: Hailey Kinsel – Cotulla, Texas ($148,867) 3-time WNFR qualifier 2018 World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-511 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hailey-Kinsel.jpg" alt="Hailey Kinsel – Cotulla, Texas ($148,867) 3-time WNFR qualifier 2018 World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hailey-Kinsel.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hailey-Kinsel-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that no one had heard of Hailey Kinsel, but she and her great mare DM Sissy Hayday “Sister” have not only become superstars in the barrel racing world, their rise to success in the rodeo arena has given the Kinsel name notoriety.</p>
<p>It started in 2017 when they won RFD-TV’s The American. Then came a college championship for Texas A&amp;M University and their first trip to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo where they set an arena record and an earnings record.</p>
<p><strong>Stevi Hillman</strong>: Stevi Hillman – Weatherford, Texas ($105,335) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-512 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stevi-Hillman.jpg" alt="Stevi Hillman – Weatherford, Texas ($105,335) 4-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stevi-Hillman.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stevi-Hillman-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>For any barrel racer to achieve greatness, it takes a team. For Stevi Hillman, it has also taken a Truck.</p>
<p>Stevi is on her way to her fourth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo and while she has ridden several different horses, there has been one that has been instrumental in her success. That horse is 12-year-old gelding Cuatro Fame, “Truck.”</p>
<p>There are several constants in her life. Her faith in God, her husband Ty, and her desire to win. Truck has been right there too. This year he has won the majority of her $105,335 during the regular season putting her in sixth place to start the NFR.</p>
<p>Stevi first qualified for the NFR in 2016. That same year, her husband, Ty Hillman, started his own personal coaching business – Prepare to Win. That has become a way of life for this duo as they listen to motivational speakers as they drive, try to eat healthy and get rest on the road and put their faith to good use.</p>
<p><strong>Nellie Miller</strong>: Nellie Miller – Cottonwood, Calif. ($154,611) 4-time WNFR qualifier 2017 World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-513 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nellie-Miller.jpg" alt="Nellie Miller – Cottonwood, Calif. ($154,611) 4-time WNFR qualifier 2017 World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nellie-Miller.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nellie-Miller-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Nellie Miller not only has the distinction of entering her fourth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in first place, she did it by entering fewer rodeos than any of her other competitors.</p>
<p>It’s not just because she has a super star horse in Rafter W Minnie Reba, the 11-year-old mare that everyone knows as Sister. Sister was raised and trained by Nellie’s father Sam Williams and is a full sister to the horse that Nellie competed on at her first NFR.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because they raised and trained the mare, and maybe it’s just because of the partnership they have formed, but Nellie has figured out exactly what rodeos Sister likes and where they will excel. Needless to say, they have a high winning percentage. They earned $154,611 during the regular season and did that at 28 rodeos.</p>
<p><strong>Ericka Nelson</strong>: Ericka Nelson – Century, Fla. ($93,433) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-514 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ericka-Nelson.jpg" alt="Ericka Nelson – Century, Fla. ($93,433) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ericka-Nelson.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ericka-Nelson-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Ask Ericka Nelson about the learning curve in rodeo. It took her three years to get to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo and it wasn’t from lack of effort or winning.</p>
<p>Ericka joined the WPRA in 2001. She went to circuit rodeos and stayed pretty close to home in Century, Florida. She rode outside horses and did some training. One of the horses that came to her in those days was PC Cash “Bud.” He came to Ericka as a three-year-old, she started training him and taking him to futurities. Because she didn’t want to travel and go “out west” but wanted Bud to have those opportunities he was sold.</p>
<p>Then Goodfrenchmanfriday “Friday” came into her life and she couldn’t turn down the opportunity to ride him. She saw it as an opportunity to show the rest of the world the quality of horses there are in Florida, so she hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi</strong>: Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi – Lampasas, Texas ($105,503) 13-time WNFR qualifier 2-time World Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-515 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Brittany-Pozzi-Tonozzi.jpg" alt="Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi – Lampasas, Texas ($105,503) 13-time WNFR qualifier 2-time World Champion" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Brittany-Pozzi-Tonozzi.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Brittany-Pozzi-Tonozzi-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Brittany Pozzi-Tonozzi just might have a horse problem. It’s a self-proclaimed part of her barrel racing addiction.</p>
<p>That addiction has led to 13 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualifications, well over $2 million in career earnings and two world championships. It’s also developed her horsemanship as she has ridden so many different horses and gained experience and knowledge from each one.</p>
<p>Her love of the sport led to ventures outside of the arena starting a breeding business. She and her husband Garrett Tonozzi have about 50 horses in their care and do a large percentage of the work themselves.</p>
<p>Add a two-year-old daughter (Tinlee born March of 2017) and their lives have to be nothing short of chaotic. Even with the chaos, Brittany has managed to travel coast to coast, earn $105,503 during the regular season and will start this year’s NFR in fifth place.</p>
<p>On the “Married With Horses” podcast, she told Lane and Jackie Jatzlau that she would really be happy if she won fifth place at every rodeo she went to. All of those fifth-place checks would add up and with going to 67 rodeos would likely get someone to the NFR.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Miller</strong>: Emily Miller – Weatherford, Okla. ($98,145) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-516 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emily-Miller.jpeg" alt="Emily Miller – Weatherford, Okla. ($98,145) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emily-Miller.jpeg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emily-Miller-240x300.jpeg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Emily Miller grew up on a farm in Kansas with family that wasn’t involved with horses. Her babysitter was a barrel racer and that started an interest that is not only a lifelong passion for Emily, it forged a lifelong relationship with that babysitter, Jana (Wehkamp) Turner.</p>
<p>Emily’s parents supported her love of horses and competing in rodeos but they also were realistic about the endeavors. She competed in five events in high school and was the Kansas all-around champion on three occasions.</p>
<p>When she was a sophomore in high school her parents bought her a horse for the last time. They were still supportive but knew that she needed to learn to make it on her own and treat rodeo like a business.</p>
<p>She got rodeo scholarships for college and started out at the nearby Garden City Community College. Then she transferred to Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford and got her dental hygiene degree.</p>
<p><strong>Shali Lord</strong>: Shali Lord – Lamar, Colo. ($111,776) 2-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-517 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shali-Lord.jpg" alt="Shali Lord – Lamar, Colo. ($111,776) 2-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shali-Lord.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shali-Lord-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>A lot of things have changed since Shali Lord qualified for her first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 2005.</p>
<p>While the competition is essentially the same, the NFR payout has nearly doubled going from $5,104,424 to $10,000. Each of the 10 rounds is worth about $12,000 more for winners and the overall NFR champion will earn $27,000 more than the 2005 winner did.</p>
<p>When Shali, from Lamar, Colorado, qualified in 2005, she rode a little bay rocket, SX Docs Slider “Slider” that either got her to the pay window or hit a barrel. It was exciting to watch and that duo stole the hearts of many fans. She ended up third in the world with $143,348. This year she enters the competition fourth in the world with $111,776, just $31,572 less than she won during the whole 2005 season.</p>
<p><strong>Cheyenne Wimberley</strong>: Cheyenne Wimberley – Stephenville, Texas ($90,361) 3-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-518 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cheyenne-Wimberley.jpg" alt="Cheyenne Wimberley – Stephenville, Texas ($90,361) 3-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cheyenne-Wimberley.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cheyenne-Wimberley-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>It’s been 20 years since Cheyenne Wimberley ran down the alley at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center to compete in the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.</p>
<p>The Stephenville, Texas, cowgirl joined the WPRA shortly after hitting double digits. It wasn’t long until she was finding success in the rodeo arena. She filled her permit when she was 11 at the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque. The next year she was the Turquoise Circuit Rookie of the Year. She made her first of two consecutive appearances at the NFR in 1998.</p>
<p>After her good horse sustained a career-ending injury, Cheyenne walked away from professional rodeo and its grueling travel schedule. She finished college at Tarleton State University, earned her realtor’s license, became a horse insurance broker and founded Cowboy Classic Saddlery with her parents. She kept her passion for barrel racing, finding her niche training futurity horses.</p>
<p><strong>Ivy Conrado-Saebens</strong>: Ivy Conrado – Nowata, Okla. ($93,269) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-519 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ivy-Conrado.jpg" alt="Ivy Conrado – Nowata, Okla. ($93,269) 4-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ivy-Conrado.jpg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ivy-Conrado-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>This has been a year of change outside of the rodeo arena for Ivy Conrado-Saebens, but her barrel racing has been on a steady winning path.</p>
<p>She qualified for her fourth consecutive Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in barrel racing and her ten-year-old mare KNFabs Gift of Fame “JLo” was named AQHA Purina Reserve Barrel Horse of the Year for the second straight year. Ivy has $93,269 in regular-season earnings and will start the NFR in 11th place.</p>
<p>Last year she placed in six of the ten rounds at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, finishing eighth in the average. She won the fifth round, earning the go-round buckle, finished third in the first, sixth and seventh rounds and took sixth in the third and tenth rounds. Ivy won $98,000 to nearly double her regular season winnings and finish the year ranked sixth.</p>
<p>On the personal side, Ivy moved to Nowata, Oklahoma, early this year, where her fiancé Billie Jack Saebens is head trainer for Dixon Flowers Rope Horses.</p>
<p>The couple had a chance to be one of the relatively few husband-wife duos to qualify for the WNFR in the same year. Saebens, a two-time WNFR qualifier in team roping, just missed the cut this year, finishing 16th in the heeler standings, just $2,200 short of the Top 15.</p>

<p>Dona Kay Rule has said that at 60-plus years of age, it’s her turn. She proved that by qualifying for her first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo and doing it on a horse that 20 years ago she probably would have sold.</p>
<p>The Minco, Oklahoma resident doesn’t remember a time when horses weren’t a part of her life or when she didn’t want to go ride. Her father competed in rodeos. She was showing horses. Her father was entered in the team roping at a rodeo and they had to hustle from the horse show to get there. Dona Kay had won ribbons at the horse show but when she saw that her father got money for winning at the rodeo, her focus changed.</p>
<p>She met her husband, John Rule, inside the National Saddlery shop in Oklahoma City. That’s a business that they bought and ran together for years. Dona Kay was also raising two children and training barrel racing horses.</p>
<p><strong>Amberleigh Moore</strong>: Amberleigh Moore – Salem, Ore. ($93,059) 4-time WNFR qualifier</p>

<p>Amberleigh Moore will be making her fourth consecutive trip to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. The Salem, Oregon, barrel racer has earned her berth nearly every possible way in those four years.</p>
<p>Her ten-year-old mare CP Dark Moon, who her husband Paul nicknamed Paige, has excelled in the atmosphere at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center</p>
<p>Four years ago, she barely squeaked into the barrel racing field in 15th, but placed in eight of the 10 rounds, winning three. She won almost $187,000 at the finals, finished as reserve world champion and was the high money winner among the barrel racers.</p>
<p>The next year she came into Las Vegas ranked fourth and again won three rounds and placed in two others, winning nearly $120,000 at the WNFR.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Lockhart</strong>: Lisa Lockhart – Oelrichs, S.D. (146,352) 13-time WNFR qualifier 2-time WNFR Champion</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-522 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lisa-Lockhart.jpg" alt="Lisa Lockhart – Oelrichs, S.D.

<p>Maybe 13 will be the magic number for South Dakota’s Lisa Lockhart. Her fans are certainly hoping so.</p>
<p>When she rides into the Thomas and Mack Center for the 2019 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, it will be for her 13th qualification. Much of her success in Las Vegas has been aboard An Oakie With Cash “Louie.”</p>
<p>Louie has been a standout in Las Vegas, taking Lisa to two NFR championships. At 16-years-old, the buckskin gelding has already made 80 trips around the barrels there. That’s 80 right turns and 160 left. Lisa has another buckskin mount that she won a round on at last year’s NFR, Rosas Cantina CC “Rosa,” nine, that looks very similar to Louie. The biggest difference is when they enter the arena, Louie goes right, Rosa goes left.</p>
<p>She also got help this year from an eight-year-old Prime Diamond “Cutter” that took her to her first national title. Last March, with Louie on the inured list and Rosa busy with breeding season, Lisa’s top two horses weren’t available for competition. She was representing the Badlands Circuit at the RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo (for the 15th time) and had a big decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Routier</strong>: Jessica Routier – Buffalo, S.D. ($96,507) 2-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-523 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jessica-Routier.jpg" alt="Jessica Routier – Buffalo, S.D.

<p>Last year was a learning experience for Jessica Routier that led to her first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualification and taught her how to get back there again.</p>
<p>After finishing the 2018 season as the reserve world champion, she got into the lucrative winter rodeos hoping that the palomino mare, Fiery Miss West, that she rides would shine over the winter. “Missy” did just that and before the busy summer run, they had been to 10 rodeos and won nearly $40,000.</p>
<p>Jessica is a planner and with five children, a ranch and plenty of horses to ride, those plans play a critical role in her success. This year she went to 54 rodeos and won $96,507 to finish the regular season in eighth place.</p>
<p>As she schedules those rodeos, she plans the trips so she is never gone from home for more than two weeks. Her husband Riley Routier is part of a ranching family that takes care of 800 head of cattle.</p>
<p><strong>Lacinda Rose</strong>: Lacinda Rose – Willard, Mo. ($88,936) First-time WNFR qualifier</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-524 aligncenter" src="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lacinda-Rose.jpeg" alt="Lacinda Rose – Willard, Mo. ($88,936) First-time WNFR qualifier" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lacinda-Rose.jpeg 400w, https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lacinda-Rose-240x300.jpeg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Making her first appearance at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is barrel racer Lacinda Rose of Willard, Missouri.</p>
<p>Lacinda qualified for Las Vegas in the 15th (and last) position, but with a $10,000 cushion over 16th-ranked Leia Pluemer. She is the first person from Missouri to qualify in the barrel racing since Amanda Clayman in 2004. They are the only two Missouri barrel racers to compete at the NFR since it moved to Las Vegas 34 years ago. She and team roper Paul Eaves will represent the “Show Me” state this year.</p>
<p>Her main mount has been RR Meradas Real Deal, an 11-year-old product of her father-in-law’s breeding program. Her husband Adam, a PRCA tie-down and team roper, trained Real Deal as a heading horse and Lacinda trained him on barrels.</p>
<p>Adam has qualified for four RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeos and won the Fort Worth Stock Show &amp; Rodeo in January with partner Jett Hillman.</p>
