										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the anticipation builds for the highly awaited return of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, rodeo fans are in for a treat with an array of exciting entertainment options both before and after each thrilling rodeo performance. Renowned as the world&#8217;s most prestigious and lucrative rodeo event, the Wrangler NFR is scheduled from Thursday, December 7, to Saturday, December 16.</p>
<p>To ensure convenient travel, enthusiasts can opt for the complimentary NFR Express Shuttle Bus service, available from 26 sponsor hotel properties and The Cowboy Channel Cowboy Christmas. Upon arrival, visitors will be immersed in a vibrant rodeo-themed atmosphere, extending from the outdoor grounds to the interior of the venue.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, the ProRodeo Zone awaits, offering PRCA sponsor-activation tents, live music, and an energetic ambiance. As fans make their way towards the entrance, they will pass through the lively StubHub Fan Zone, encompassing additional sponsor tents, the official ProRodeo and Wrangler NFR merchandise trailer, as well as a delectable assortment of food and beverage choices. Video screens and communal tables provide a perfect setting for attendees to gather and enjoy the festivities.</p>
<p>Amplifying the excitement, two outdoor video boards fixed on the arena&#8217;s façade will broadcast captivating Wrangler NFR moments, engaging highlight reels, interactive content, and compelling contestant interviews.</p>
<p>Upon stepping inside the building, one of the venue&#8217;s main highlights is the 36,000-square-foot hospitality area situated at the northwest end of the arena. A brand-new addition, the Cowboy Channel Bar, will feature a saloon and a 2,500-square-foot, glass-enclosed balcony with panoramic Strip views. The Cowboy Channel will host the NFR Pre-Show at 5 p.m. and the NFR Post-Show immediately following each night&#8217;s performance. Visitors can also delve into the rich history of the NFR in Las Vegas at an all-encompassing exhibit. Access to The Cowboy Channel Bar is open to all fans holding a Wrangler NFR ticket for the evening&#8217;s performance and will include the live broadcast of the rodeo, displayed on a large projection screen.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, on the arena&#8217;s southeast side, opposite The Cowboy Channel Bar, the returning Cowboy Corral promises a vibrant and engaging experience. Taking over the adjacent Cox Pavilion, it offers live music, a spacious bar, and ample seating for relaxation and enjoyment. The lively entertainment lineup includes pre and post-event performances by Will Jones (Dec. 7-9), Mae Estes (Dec. 10-11), Old Hickory (Dec. 12-14), and Wyatt McCubbin (Dec. 15-16). Doors open at 4 pm, with live music commencing at 4:45 pm.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the Cowboy Corral lies the Bull &amp; Barrel Saloon, boasting its own bar and food service, along with the Hall of Champions, paying tribute to former NFR champions.</p>
<p>As the evening progresses, the entertainment continues to captivate the audience.

<p>Renowned rodeo photographer James Fain, who had a remarkable career spanning 60 years, passed away on May 10 at the age of 80. Fain&#8217;s journey began in Logan, Utah, his hometown, where the Cache County Fair and Rodeo marked the end of his illustrious tenure in ProRodeo on August 13, 2022.</p>
<p>Although born in Iowa, Fain was raised in Arizona, where his fascination with rodeo first took root. In an August 19, 2022, interview with the <a href="https://prorodeo.com/">ProRodeo Sports News</a>, Fain recalled his early involvement as a contestant when a grade school friend convinced him to participate in the Phoenix Jaycees Junior Rodeo. Competing in calf riding, Fain humorously admitted, &#8220;I fell off.&#8221;</p>
<p>While his time as a competitor was sporadic, Fain developed a keen interest in the sport. He jokingly distinguished himself from other contestants, quipping, &#8220;I got on them, that was about it.&#8221; Fain tackled bareback riding, bull riding, and steer wrestling, reflecting on the challenges and dispelling any romantic notions associated with the so-called &#8220;good old days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite his personal struggles, Fain&#8217;s fascination with rodeo persisted. As he mingled with a Western crowd, he found himself captivated by Western Horseman magazine&#8217;s rodeo stories featuring the photographs of Devere Helfrich, the official photographer of the then Rodeo Cowboys Association. Intrigued by these images, Fain dabbled in photography himself, armed with a modest camera, capturing moments at junior rodeos.</p>
<p>In 1961, at the age of 19, Fain achieved his first published photos in the Rodeo Sports News, the precursor to the PSN (ProRodeo Sports News), coincidentally featured alongside Helfrich&#8217;s work. The following year, he acquired his RCA (Rodeo Cowboys Association) card. Fain shared his early experiences, recalling his initial shot of Ronnie Rossen in Douglas, Arizona, where the action was excellent but the focus slightly off. Undeterred, he reminisced about other successful photos in subsequent issues, including a bareback rider in Brawley, California, and a saddle bronc in Payson, Arizona, showcasing improved focus.</p>
<p>Fain&#8217;s photographic expertise made his images highly sought-after by contestants and media outlets alike. Adapting to evolving technology, he seamlessly transitioned from film processing, often in motel bathrooms on the road, to uploading digital photos on a laptop. Fain admitted that even with modern autofocus capabilities, capturing the perfect shot remained elusive. While color photography offered striking images, his affinity for black and white persisted.</p>
<p>Over the years, Fain faced various challenges, but he approached them with a lighthearted perspective. He found bull riding to be the easiest to photograph, particularly saddle broncs, thanks to the Wrights&#8217; influence. Fain celebrated his 50th year photographing PRCA rodeos at the Evanston Cowboy Days in Wyoming. During his illustrious career, he was honored as ProRodeo&#8217;s Photographer of the Year twice and covered significant events such as the <a href="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/">National Finals Rodeo</a>, Dodge National Circuit Finals Rodeo, National High School Finals, <a href="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/college-national-finals-rodeo-live-stream/">College National Finals Rodeo</a>, Indian National Finals, and numerous other ProRodeos, Utah High School rodeos, and college rodeos.</p>
<p>Fain&#8217;s talent also earned him a place among the photographers at the Command Performance Rodeo organized by the PRCA at Maryland&#8217;s Capital Centre on September 24, 1983. This exclusive event, graced by special guests President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, hosted 10,249 government dignitaries, including ambassadors from 46 foreign countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/billy-etbauer/10309">Billy Etbauer</a> is a retired American professional rodeo cowboy who competed in the sport of saddle bronc riding. He was born on March 9, 1966, in Ree Heights, South Dakota, and grew up on a ranch in western South Dakota. Etbauer comes from a family of rodeo cowboys, including his brothers Robert and Dan, who are also accomplished saddle bronc riders.</p>
<p>During his career, Etbauer won three Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) world championships in saddle bronc riding, in 1992, 1996, and 1999. He also won the all-around cowboy title at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1999, which is awarded to the competitor who earns the most money across all events at the <a href="https://portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/">NFR</a>.</p>
<p>Etbauer retired from professional rodeo in 2016 after a long and successful career. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest saddle bronc riders of all time, and his accomplishments have earned him induction into the <a href="https://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/">ProRodeo Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Etbauer reset numerous NFR-related records. In 2005, he broke the record for most saddle bronc earnings at NFR, a record he had already reset the year before. In 2007, he passed Tom Reeves for most NFR qualifications all-time in the event and continued to add to it, reaching 21 trips before concluding his career.</p>
<p>But even Etbauer acknowledges that after 20 years it&#8217;s surprising that his 93 has only been tied, not broken. <a href="https://www.prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898">Stetson Wright</a> pulled even with the mark in 2021 on Vitalix Ricky Bobby from Cervi Championship Rodeo.</p>
<p>And despite those two incredible rides that have stood the test of time, Etbauer will argue they could have been better. That&#8217;s the mindset that made him a world champion then and helps him keep a grip on world records two decades later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it was actually a 93 or not, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell you how much it was one way or another, but I can assure you I was always picking it apart, looking for where I could have done something else a whole lot better,&#8221; Etbauer said. &#8220;Anytime I got off, I always thought there was something I could have done better.&#8221;</p>
