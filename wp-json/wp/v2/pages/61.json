The 32nd event involves nearly 350 vendors whose wares are spread over 444,000 square feet \u2014 about seven and a half football fields \u2014 in the LVCC\u2019s South Halls. And surprise at the sheer scale was in the air on opening day Thursday, with overheard comments such as:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis thing goes farther than I can see.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And the inevitable: \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten very far yet.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Best of all, as the Thorps noted, it\u2019s free \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to pay $10 to park..<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Cowboy Christmas, which runs through Saturday, may be the best entertainment value in town right now, a wild circus of colors and sparkle and sometimes-frenetic activity that draws about 230,000 people who range from babies in strollers to old-timers using canes.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of city slickers but also a heck of a lot of cowboys and cowgirls, like the rodeo stars signing autographs, the guy carrying his son\u2019s saddle over his shoulder on a strap, and the subject of the overheard, \u201cEvery time she barrel races \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The holidays are very much in evidence in displays, decorations and country singers\u2019 carols on the halls\u2019 speakers, but this show is really more about cowboys than Christmas. There\u2019s plenty to see even if you\u2019re not shopping. But if you are, and the item you seek has anything to do with the cowboy lifestyle, it\u2019s probably available here. Consider:<\/p>\n<p>Anything conceivable to outfit a horse, including bridles, bits, tools, colorful tailored blankets with matching fly masks, waterers, slow feed hay nets, flexible rein keepers, saddles ranging from relatively plain to those with finely tooled leather or silver trim and crystals, Impact Gel saddle pads, leather straps with bronze bells attached in a wide range of sizes, ornate bell boots for covering horses\u2019 hooves, (even glittery strips for those hooves), steel corral components, feed and medical supplies.<\/p>\n<p>Or to outfit a cowboy or cowgirl, such as boots, boots and more boots, in an endless array of colors (purple? teal?) and sizes. Cowboy hats, custom hat-making shops, hat-steaming spots and hat cases for travel. Handbags, including the concealed-carry variety. Jewelry. Clothing ranging from T-shirts to finely tailored leather garments. Oilskin dusters. Scarves. Belts. Holsters. Work gloves. Spurs. Fox tails. Books and other material for the Christian roper and barrel racer. A camo or purple beer belt that can hold a whole six-pack.<\/p>\n<p>Or to outfit a ranch, whether it be a suburban tract home or on a massive spread in Texas: Everything for a cowboy Christmas tree, including ornaments, denim or bandanna-print garland and accents such as a $325 hand-pieced cowhide tree skirt. Tooled leather furniture and accessories including chairs, ottomans, stools, benches, buckets and wall hangings. Nevada wild-horse photography. Western photography, paintings and posters. Bronze statuary including a monumental $65,000 stag. Exercise machines. Pendulum swings with canopies. Barrel smokers. Humidifiers (hey, it\u2019s a desert out there). Dishes, silverware, napkin rings, table runners, leather trivets and kitchen tools with handles ornately embossed in the Western style. Rugs of all sizes. Tennessee Moonshine cakes, jams, honey and hot sauce. Large metal ranch signs, and indoor signs that say things like \u201cLive every day like it\u2019s Taco Tuesday\u201d or \u201cShopping with your husband is like hunting with the game warden.\u201d Make-your-own bourbon, whiskey, Scotch and rum. Vintage coin-operated horse rides, the kind that used to be outside every grocery store in the country. Roping dummies in action, giving kids an opportunity to try their hand. Even NFR 60th anniversary commemorative firearms.<\/p>\n<p>Maureen Frank of Parker, Colorado, walking around with a regulation NFR jacket, said she\u2019s attended the annual event 15 to 20 times, and comes in large part because her favorite jeweler, Ornaments, is an exhibitor.<\/p>\n<p>Veronica Ambriz, who co-owns Ambriz Jewelry in Fredericksburg, Texas, with her husband, Adolfo, has been attending every year since 2000 to offer the couple\u2019s silver, leather and wood creations. She said the show is a collection of mini-cultures that often can be identified by what they\u2019re wearing. A guy in a Stetson is likely to be from Texas or the Southwest, she said, while Montana cowboys wear round hats. Those from Montana also like to wear silk scarves, she said; \u201cin Texas it\u2019s too hot.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe love the show,\u201d said Ambriz, who said the couple does the Texas rodeo circuit as well. \u201cWhere else do you see, in one spot, so many cowboys from all over \u2014 east to west, all over the United States? Every state has their own little culture, but it\u2019s all one big cowboy culture.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s a perfect complement to the NFR activities all week long!
