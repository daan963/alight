The Stampede Rodeo features the world\u2019s best competitors and animals. Every afternoon at 1:30 p.m., cowboys and cowgirls face off in a furious display of skill and grit, with every win building towards Showdown Sunday, at the World\u2019s Largest Outdoor Rodeo.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<h3>Stampede Rodeo Events<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>The Calgary Stampede Rodeo is sanctioned by the PRCA. Performances include both judged and timed events. Cowboys and cowgirls compete against one another for the highest score or the shortest time. Top athletes walk away with cash prizes and commemorative belt buckles. Each of the six Pro Rodeo performances includes:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<h4>Barrel Racing<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>This event requires control, attention to detail, and a close partnership between horse and rider. Competing against the clock, contestants circle three barrels in a cloverleaf pattern and race back across the scoreline. Time is measured with an electronic eye timer, and a hundredth of a second can determine who wins. A rider may touch a barrel, but if she knocks one over a five-second penalty is added to her total time.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<h3>Bull Riding<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>In the world-renowned Calgary Stampede bull riding, cowboys engage in a test of nerves against a bull.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>A thick braided bullrope, complete with handhold, is wrapped around the bull and weighed down by a cowbell that allows the rope to fall when the ride is over. The rope is only kept tight by the bull rider\u2019s grip.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>He must try to keep his arm from straightening and his hand from breaking loose before the end of the ride. The cowboy isn\u2019t required to move his feet\u2014staying on is hard enough\u2014but if he does spur, he gets higher marks.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Tie-Down Roping<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>In Tie-Down Roping, the cowboy and his equine partner re-create one of ranching\u2019s oldest tasks: roping and tying an animal.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>Speed, skill, and finesse are key in this event. The cowboy waits on horseback behind a rope barrier. When he gives a nod, the calf is released and gets a 10-ft. head start.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>The cowboy must quickly rope the calf, dismount on the run to reach it, turn it on its side, and tie three of its legs. Time is called when the cowboy throws his hands in the air, and the calf is immediately released.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Steer Wrestling<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>It\u2019s cowboy vs the clock in this event, which requires coordination and strength. The steer wrestler waits on horseback behind a rope barrier. When he gives a nod, the steer is released and gets a 12-ft. head start. The cowboy chases the steer, then drops from his horse and grabs its horns to bring it to a halt. The steer must be on its feet before being rolled to the ground. Once on its side with all legs extended, the official time is taken. An extra horse, ridden by a hazer, is required to keep the steer running straight.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Saddle Bronc<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>Rhythm between a cowboy and his horse is key in Saddle Bronc.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>The rider moves his feet from the horse\u2019s neck toward the back of the saddle, in time with the bronc\u2019s bucking action. The cowboy holds on to a braided rein that is connected to the horse\u2019s halter, using it to help balance himself. If his hand placement is too low on the rein, he could be pulled over the front; too high, and he may be bucked off the back before his eight seconds are up.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Bareback<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>In the Bareback event, the rider holds on to the leather handhold of a rigging\u2014a pad wrapped around the bucking horse\u2019s girth\u2014as he first extends his feet far forward. He then pulls his feet back up toward the rigging in a spurring motion. The higher the spurs, the higher the score.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>The stress on the cowboy\u2019s arm is intense as it absorbs most of the horse\u2019s power, but he needs to hold on for at least 8 seconds.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<h3>Calgary Stampede Evening Show<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>It will be an Evening Show like you\u2019ve never seen before. A combination of grit, glamour, live music and celebration.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"Article-paragraph\">\n<p>A new doubleheader for Stampede 2021 only: Broncs After Dark and the Bell Grandstand Show.
