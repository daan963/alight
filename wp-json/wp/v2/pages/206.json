The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Media<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included.

These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you log in, we will set up several cookies to save your login information and screen display choices. Login cookies last two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select &#8220;Remember Me,&#8221; your login will persist for two weeks. The login cookies will be removed if you log out of your account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An additional cookie will be saved in your browser if you edit or publish an article. This cookie includes no personal data and indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Embedded content from other websites<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves similarly as if the visitor has visited another website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who do we share your data with?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your IP address will be included in the reset email if you request a password reset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long we retain your data?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely if you leave a comment. This is so we can automatically recognize and approve any follow-up comments instead of holding them in a moderation queue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What rights do you have over your data?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we must keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where is your data sent?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Children\u2019s Privacy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Service does not address anyone under 18 (\u201cChildren\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18.
