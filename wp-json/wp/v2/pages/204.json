It bills itself as the &#8220;World&#8217;s Largest Outdoor Rodeo and Western Celebration.&#8221; The event, claimed to be one of the largest of its kind in the world, draws nearly 200,000 annually. Lodging fills up quickly during the peak tourist season throughout southern and eastern Wyoming, into northern Colorado and western Nebraska. The celebration is held during the ten days centered about the last full week of July. In 2008, Cheyenne Frontier Days was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.<\/p>\n<h2>Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo<\/h2>\n<p>Cheyenne Frontier Days\u2122, the 10-day event consists of three categories for competitions; Rough-Stock Events (bareback, saddle bronc, and bull riding), Timed Events (Team and Tie-down Roping, Steer Wrestling, and Barrel Racing), and Racing on the Track (Wild Horse Races).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1147\" src=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cheyenne-frontier-days-rodeo.jpg\" alt=\"125th Annual Cheyenne Frontier Days July 23- August 1, 2021\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cheyenne-frontier-days-rodeo.jpg 800w, https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cheyenne-frontier-days-rodeo-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cheyenne-frontier-days-rodeo-768x403.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>New to Cheyenne Frontier Days\u2122 is breakaway roping. Breakaway roping is a women\u2019s event; it can be compared to the tie-down roping, as the cowgirl ropes the calf, the rope \u201cbreaks away,\u201d as she quickly stops, the cowgirl does not dismount, flank or tie the animal. Breakaway is often a Women\u2019s Pro Rodeo Association (WPRA) -sanctioned event; it will not be considered a sanctioned event by the WPRA in Cheyenne. Two hundred breakaway ropers will compete in Cheyenne, with $10,000 in prize money. The Cheyenne Frontier Days breakaway champion will receive a buckle and saddle, just like the champs from the other events. The competition will start with a clean slate on Finals Sunday and the the highest scores and the fastest times will be the 2021 CFD Champions!
