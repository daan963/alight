Tickets can be purchased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renorodeo.com\/shop\/tickets\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Main_Events\">Main Events<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Nine main events have historically taken place at the College National Finals Rodeo. Each event has its own monetary prizes that are paid out, and those payouts are determined by each top-placing competitor\u2019s rank in relation to the event\u2019s overall prize pool. Individuals placed in the top-six of a particular event are paid out accordingly, while individuals placed in the top-eight of the overall Reno Rodeo are also paid out. The Reno\u2019s main events are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saddle Bronc Riding: <\/strong>Bronc riding, either bareback bronc or saddle bronc competition, is a rodeo event that involves a rodeo participant riding a bucking horse that attempts to throw or buck off the rider.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bareback Riding:<\/strong> Bareback riding is a form of horseback riding without a saddle. It requires skill, balance, and coordination, as the rider does not have any equipment to compensate for errors of balance or skill.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bull Riding:<\/strong> Bull riding is a rodeo sport that involves a rider getting on a bucking bull and attempting to stay mounted while the animal tries to buck off the rider. American bull riding has been called \u201cthe most dangerous eight seconds in sports.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tie Down Roping:<\/strong> Calf roping, also known as tie-down roping, is a rodeo event that features a calf and a rider mounted on a horse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Steer Wrestling:<\/strong> Steer wrestling, also known as bulldogging, is a rodeo event in which a horse-mounted rider chases a steer, drops from the horse to the steer, then wrestles the steer to the ground by grabbing its horns and pulling it off-balance so that it falls to the ground. The event carries a high risk of injury to the cowboy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Team Roping:<\/strong> Team roping also known as heading and heeling is a rodeo event that features a steer (typically a Corriente) and two mounted riders. The first roper is referred to as the \u201cheader\u201d, the person who ropes the front of the steer, usually around the horns, but it is also legal for the rope to go around the neck, or go around one horn and the nose resulting in what they call a \u201chalf head\u201d. Once the steer is caught by one of the three legal head catches, the header must dally (wrap the rope around the rubber covered saddle horn) and use his horse to turn the steer to the left.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Barrel Racing:<\/strong> Barrel racing is a rodeo event in which a horse and rider attempt to complete a cloverleaf pattern around preset barrels in the fastest time. Though both boys and girls compete at the youth level, in collegiate and professional ranks, it is a rodeo event for women.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Breakaway Roping:<\/strong> Breakaway roping is a variation of calf roping where a calf is roped, but not thrown and tied. It is a rodeo event that features a calf and one mounted rider. The calves are moved one at a time through narrow runs leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Goat Tying:<\/strong> Goat tying is a rodeo event that is typically seen in youth, high school and college rodeos in which the participant rides to a tethered goat, dismounts, catches, throws, and ties any three of its legs together. The goat must stay tied for six seconds after the contestant has backed away from the animal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The \u201cWildest, Richest Rodeo in the West,\u201d is back!
