Each event has its own monetary prizes that are paid out, and those payouts are determined by each top-placing competitor\u2019s rank in relation to the event\u2019s overall prize pool. Individuals placed in the top-six of a particular event are paid out accordingly, while individuals placed in the top-eight of the overall CNFR are also paid out. The CNFR\u2019s main events are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saddle Bronc Riding: <\/strong>Bronc riding, either bareback bronc or saddle bronc competition, is a rodeo event that involves a rodeo participant riding a bucking horse that attempts to throw or buck off the rider.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bareback Riding:<\/strong> Bareback riding is a form of horseback riding without a saddle. It requires skill, balance, and coordination, as the rider does not have any equipment to compensate for errors of balance or skill.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bull Riding:<\/strong> Bull riding is a rodeo sport that involves a rider getting on a bucking bull and attempting to stay mounted while the animal tries to buck off the rider. American bull riding has been called &#8220;the most dangerous eight seconds in sports.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tie Down Roping:<\/strong> Calf roping, also known as tie-down roping, is a rodeo event that features a calf and a rider mounted on a horse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Steer Wrestling:<\/strong> Steer wrestling, also known as bulldogging, is a rodeo event in which a horse-mounted rider chases a steer, drops from the horse to the steer, then wrestles the steer to the ground by grabbing its horns and pulling it off-balance so that it falls to the ground. The event carries a high risk of injury to the cowboy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Team Roping:<\/strong> Team roping also known as heading and heeling is a rodeo event that features a steer (typically a Corriente) and two mounted riders. The first roper is referred to as the &#8220;header&#8221;, the person who ropes the front of the steer, usually around the horns, but it is also legal for the rope to go around the neck, or go around one horn and the nose resulting in what they call a &#8220;half head&#8221;. Once the steer is caught by one of the three legal head catches, the header must dally (wrap the rope around the rubber covered saddle horn) and use his horse to turn the steer to the left.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Barrel Racing:<\/strong> Barrel racing is a rodeo event in which a horse and rider attempt to complete a cloverleaf pattern around preset barrels in the fastest time. Though both boys and girls compete at the youth level, in collegiate and professional ranks, it is a rodeo event for women.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Breakaway Roping:<\/strong> Breakaway roping is a variation of calf roping where a calf is roped, but not thrown and tied. It is a rodeo event that features a calf and one mounted rider. The calves are moved one at a time through narrow runs leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Goat Tying:<\/strong> Goat tying is a rodeo event that is typically seen in youth, high school and college rodeos in which the participant rides to a tethered goat, dismounts, catches, throws, and ties any three of its legs together. The goat must stay tied for six seconds after the contestant has backed away from the animal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Contestants<\/h3>\n<p>Over 400 cowboys and cowgirls from over 100 universities and colleges compete in Casper each year. Contestants compete all year in one of the NIRA\u2019s 11 regions for a chance to rope or ride at the CNFR. The top three students in each event, and top two men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams from the NIRA\u2019s 11 regions will qualify for the CNFR.<\/p>\n<h3>Rose Bowl of College Rodeo<\/h3>\n<p>The CNFR has consistently been referred to with this phrase because of the sheer massiveness of its popularity and money-generating power within the context of rodeo. The event is considered to be so big and consistently sold-out that when the 2019 College National Finals Rodeo rides into the Casper Events Center, June 9-15. According to its website, the CNFR is considered the &#8220;Rose Bowl&#8221; of college rodeo, said Bump Kraeger, one of UNL&#8217;s Rodeo Team&#8217;s coaches.<\/p>\n<h3>CNFR Standings<\/h3>\n<p>The 2019 NIRA season has been extremely competitive as a lot of the top cowboys are gunning for glory. There will be a lot of close competitions and many of the world championships could come down to the last day.
