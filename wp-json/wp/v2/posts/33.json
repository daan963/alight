Shoulders, mainly known as Jim Shoulders, was an American Professional Rodeo cowboy and a ProRodeo Hall Famer. He was the first cowboy to win three events (bareback bronc, bull riding, and all-round), including the Bull Riding Event at NFR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also a record maker as he once set a record by winning 16 world championships. However, Guy Allen later recreated history by becoming the one to win 18 world championships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Jim Shoulders is among the best and most fearless bull riders. Unfortunately, Jim left us on June 20, 2007, at 79.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"12-JW-Harris\"><\/span>12. J.W.
