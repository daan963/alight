Globe Life Field officials have emphasized that recommended health and safety standards are being met. Safety measures will include a mask requirement at all times while inside Globe Life Field and there will be additional hand washing and sanitizing stations throughout the building.<\/p>\n<p>Seats will be sold in groups of four with separation between groups. Contact-limiting measures, such as mobile tickets, have been implemented throughout the event. There will also be metal detector screenings and a no bag policy at entries on performance nights. Globe Life Field is encouraging all guests to check the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services websites for any guideline changes prior to the event.<\/p>\n<p>The Arlington and Fort Worth convention and visitors\u2019 bureaus and sports commissions are rolling out the welcome for this one-of-a-kind event and both cities have worked hard to bring the Wrangler NFR to Globe Life Field.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom cattle drives, museums and even the names of our professional sporting teams, our love of cowboy culture runs deep here in Tarrant County,\u201d Arlington Mayor Jeff Williams said. \u201cI can think of no better choice for the Super Bowl of rodeo than to be hosted here in the heart of North Texas. Arlington and Fort Worth have so many family friendly attractions and rich experiences to offer rodeo fans who will be traveling from across the country to cheer on these professional cowboys as they strive to set new records and achieve their American Dream in the arena.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nearby Fort Worth will also play host to the Wrangler NFR 2020 experience, as the annual PRCA Convention will be held November 30 to December 3, 2020, in addition to the Cowboy Christmas and a slew of other fan-favorite events.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are a rodeo city and we\u2019ve roped a big one,\u201d Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said. \u201cThe Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is an incredible win for our region and another example of how Fort Worth can host major events safely during this unprecedented time. This summer, Fort Worth has hosted major, national events in golf, racing and bull riding. Sporting events like the Wrangler NFR are a vital part of our visitor economy that creates jobs and supports our recovery.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The NFR was born in Texas and the first three years of the event were held at the Dallas State Fairgrounds beginning in 1959. Years later, the event moved to Las Vegas and has been staged at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center at UNLV in Las Vegas since 1985. That venue is not available for live entertainment with fans this year due to coronavirus restrictions in Nevada.<\/p>\n<p>In a survey earlier this summer, rodeo fans said overwhelmingly that they wanted an NFR venue that would accommodate fans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPart of what makes Globe Life Field work for us is the ability to bring in fans and deliver the full NFR experience,\u201d Taylor said.<\/p>\n<p>Organizers pledge to preserve the NFR experience that fans love and that has necessitated a one-year move out of Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>The PRCA began looking for an alternate venue earlier in the summer. The State of Texas, the Texas Rangers and Globe Life Field stepped up. Ultimately, this has been a thoughtful partnership between Texas, Globe Life Field, the cities of Arlington and Fort Worth, the Arlington Convention and Visitors Bureau, Visit Fort Worth, and the Sports Commissions of both Arlington and Fort Worth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe State of Texas knows how to do this,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed with how well this has come together for our rodeo cowboys and rodeo fans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Wrangler NFR is a 10-day event that includes the fan-favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/cowboy-christmas\/\">Cowboy Christmas<\/a> as well as the PRCA National Convention. The schedule also includes nightly Buckle Presentations, Benny Binion\u2019s World Famous Wrangler NFR Bucking Horse Sale, the PRCA Awards Banquet and Gala and the Pro Rodeo League of Women Style Show and Luncheon.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-917\" src=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/globe-life-field-in-arlington-texas.jpg\" alt=\"Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas\" width=\"643\" height=\"652\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/globe-life-field-in-arlington-texas.jpg 643w, https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/globe-life-field-in-arlington-texas-296x300.jpg 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/nfr-ticket-faqs\/\">Tickets for Wrangler NFR 2020<\/a> will go on sale to the public September 25, 2020 via texasrangers.com\/NFR.
