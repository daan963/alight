All we know is we\u2019ve gotta go fast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smith has won world titles in 2005 and 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Tomlinson acknowledged his history-making run was a blur.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I have been really nervous the last couple of nights, since this is my first time. It\u2019s just happened so fast when I\u2019m going after them, After Dustin went, I was just seeing blood.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nSaddle bronc rider Lefty Holman makes it two in a row<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take Lefty Holman long to double his Wrangler NFR pleasure. A night after winning his first career NFR round \u2013 Round 2 with an 87-point ride on Four Star Rodeo\u2019s Wall Street \u2013 Holman captured Round 3 with a 90.5-point ride on Kirsten Vold Rodeo Company\u2019s Sun Glow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my first 90 (point ride) in this building,\u201d Holman said. \u201cI\u2019d known that this horse coming into the day had won a lot of rounds so I knew if I did my job things would work out. I wanted to focus on getting my spur out. I know a couple of guys have had trouble with that so once my feet came clean, it was game over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Holman said the Round 2 victory was a key to his Round 3 win, especially mentally.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday I was much looser than I was (Friday),\u201d Holman said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as fired up. After the go-round win yesterday, it\u2019s more about proving to yourself that you belong here and you\u2019re a winner. I was a lot calmer, had more focus and even some tunnel-vision. I just hope I keep doing that throughout the week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Holman wants to keep this momentum going as he eyes a gold buckle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe world championship is definitely in the back of my mind but right now I have seven horses left in front of me,\u201d Holman said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep attacking it one horse at a time. Like I said last night, win the day, win your horse and at the end of the week see what happens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cory Solomon wins tie-down roping with 6.9-second run<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Veteran tie-down roper Cory Solomon is competing in his ninth NFR and his experience and horsepower paid off for him in Round 3.<\/p>\n<p>Solomon clocked the fastest time so far in the 2022 NFR with a 6.9-second time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went into tonight with my mind made up, I knew I drew a really good calf,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThe first two nights, I\u2019m a pretty positive person, but I knew I didn\u2019t have a good chance at winning top money, so my goal was to make a good run and hopefully get him by the hold. The first night it worked out. The second night it didn\u2019t. So, tonight drawing a good calf, I knew I had to capitalize on that, going up against the best guys in the world. These chances don\u2019t come very often. Whenever this comes you just have to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ve got to make the best of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Solomon was treating his Round 3 just like a run he does in practice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was just ready to get things going tonight, I don\u2019t think the nerves ever go away in a rodeo like this and fans like this. But I just have to control them. I treat this like my practice pen now, earlier in my career I felt like I had to show people stuff here and now it\u2019s just like my practice pen so it\u2019s good nerves now. I\u2019m just so thankful to get out there and have a good horse now that God blessed me with. I am just so thankful to be doing this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Solomon also was quick to credit his horsepower as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my good horse, his name is Play. He\u2019s from Brazil. I rode him in 2020 in Arlington, that was his first year in the U.S. and he had a little injury last year and I brought him here. I rode him one day before we left. He had been off about five months before this. I just thought I would take this opportunity to ride him as much as I can for as long as I can while he\u2019s healthy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pope rises to occasion with Round 3 victory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The last two years Jess Pope has been at his best at the Wrangler NFR winning consecutive average crowns.<\/p>\n<p>The Waverly, Kan., cowboy was in top form Saturday capturing Round 3 with an 86.5-point ride on Stace Smith Pro Rodeos\u2019 Mr. Harry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had never been on that horse. I\u2019ve seen him go a lot and I\u2019ve seen him buck a lot and I always thought that was a bucking son of gun,\u201d said Pope, 24. \u201cI was a little bit nervous when I saw my name next to him, but I sure am glad it worked out. He is one to run you off your riggin\u2019 and he is hitting you in your back trying to bring your upper body forward. It is one of those deals you have to dig down deep and see how bad you want it and see how much you can take. It is the most out of control in control chaos you have been involved in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pope has a simple approach to the remaining rounds. He\u2019s atop the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $233,149.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to take it one horse at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t control anything other than what I do and if I show up and nod my head and know that I gave it my all every time after that I\u2019m pleased with how everything ends.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steer wrestler Stetson Jorgensen muscles his way to Round 3 win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Steer wrestler Stetson Jorgensen came into the Wrangler NFR as the regular season leader and hasn\u2019t taken his foot of the gas at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.<\/p>\n<p>Jorgensen, a four-time qualifier for the NFR, leads the world standings with $213,630.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI got a really good start at the barrier, steer went to the right, which is going to happen when you get a start like I did.,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cMy hazer walled him off for me and I finished him on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you always get nervous, but it\u2019s a good nervous, when you\u2019re at the NFR if you don\u2019t have some nerves, then something is wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jorgensen was riding standout horse, Mable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMable did a great job, came from Garrett Henry and just is the type of horse that does what needs to be done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bull riders Garrett Smith and JR Stratford split Round 3 win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bull riders Garrett Smith and JR Stratford split the Round 3 victory with 90-point rides.<\/p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s ride came aboard Stace Smith Pro Rodeos\u2019 Evil Intentions and Stratford was riding Pete Carr Pro Rodeo\u2019s Curly Bill.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat bull is incredible. He got rode for a 92 last year (Creek Young, Round 3) and I knew I had a good chance to win the round. He almost got my hand from me, but I was able to hold on and stay on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole mental side of bull riding is huge, and I don\u2019t think a lot of people see it. It is physical but the mental part is huge because just like last night, you can go out and not do well and then you have to bounce right back the following night with another bucking bull.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stratford also was thrilled with his score.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve dreamed about since I was a little boy,\u201d Stratford said. \u201cI will say, the nerves were pretty high the first two rounds and it\u2019s a blessing to get one knocked down.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy adrenaline really gets running. I\u2019d say before the round there\u2019s a lot of nerves going through me but when I sat in the bucking chutes all three nights, it all went away.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barrel racer Hailey Kinsel takes another victory lap in Round 3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make it two in a row for barrel racer Hailey Kinsel. The Texas cowgirl, who won Round 3 with a 13.61-second time, was even quicker on Saturday with a 13.59-second winning time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe just worked and was outstanding,\u201d Kinsel said of Sister. \u201cI was top of the ground, first out. That\u2019s something you want to take advantage of if you can, so I was glad we were able to put it together tonight.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kinsel said the order of who runs plays a key role in strategy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne, it helps the timing for when your horse needs to be ready and then of course there\u2019s ruts,\u201d Kinsel said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have to run through them as the first out, you create them. On a night like tonight, I can really focus on going out there and doing my job knowing she will have good footing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-1st-go-round-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 1st go-round results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-round-2-results-highlights\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Round 2 Results &amp; Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>2022 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Results<br \/>\nRound 3, Dec. 3<br \/>\nThomas &amp; Mack Center, Las Vegas, Nev.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bareback Riding:<\/strong> Third round: 1.
