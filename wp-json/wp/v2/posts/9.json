Darmanin accused the 35-year-old French footballer of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood when he condemned Israel&#8217;s attacks on Palestinians last October.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>French news agency AFP reported that Benzema&#8217;s lawyer, Hugo Vigier, filed the case in the country&#8217;s special Court of Justice on Tuesday. In this court the proceedings of the cases of the ministers of France were completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Palestinian independence armed group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Israel began indiscriminate bombing of Gaza in response. When there was a storm of protest in different parts of the world, Benzema also joined in it. The Algerian-born footballer wrote on social media, &#8220;All our prayers are with the residents of Gaza, who are once again the victims of this unjust bombing, where no woman or child is spared.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>France&#8217;s Interior Minister Darmanin told CNews Channel that the Ballon d&#8217;Or winner Benzema has &#8220;notorious ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.&#8221; The Muslim Brotherhood is a Cairo-based Islamic organization that is currently banned in Egypt. However, the branches of the organization are spread all over the world. Darmanin also accused Benzema of not singing the national anthem at France national team games and proselytizing on social media.Read moreIsraeli footballer arrested for preaching war with Palestine freed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benzema protested through his lawyer shortly after Darmanin&#8217;s latest allegations. This time he walked the legal path. In the lawsuit, Benzema said, &#8220;He has never had the slightest involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood, and has no idea of \u200b\u200banyone claiming to be a member of the organization.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.prothomalo.com\/prothomalo-bangla%2F2023-08%2F41e6af89-fc56-4057-ac31-71befe969b71%2F362499_01_02.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;format=webp&amp;w=640&amp;dpr=1.3\" alt=\"\u0995\u09b0\u09bf\u09ae \u09ac\u09c7\u09a8\u099c\u09c7\u09ae\u09be \u098f\u0996\u09a8 \u09b8\u09cc\u09a6\u09bf \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09cb \u09b2\u09bf\u0997\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09b2 \u0986\u09b2 \u0987\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09a6\u09c7 \u0996\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim Benzema now plays for Saudi Pro League side Al IttihadAFP<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benzema, who is currently playing for the club Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, wrote in the case that he is being used in a political game.
