That horse is 12-year-old gelding Cuatro Fame, \u201cTruck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are several constants in her life. Her faith in God, her husband Ty, and her desire to win.

That same year, her husband, Ty Hillman, started his own personal coaching business \u2013 Prepare to Win.

It\u2019s also developed her horsemanship as she has ridden so many different horses and gained experience and knowledge from each one.<\/p>\n<p>Her love of the sport led to ventures outside of the arena starting a breeding business.

She is the first person from Missouri to qualify in the barrel racing since Amanda Clayman in 2004. They are the only two Missouri barrel racers to compete at the NFR since it moved to Las Vegas 34 years ago. She and team roper Paul Eaves will represent the \u201cShow Me\u201d state this year.<\/p>\n<p>Her main mount has been RR Meradas Real Deal, an 11-year-old product of her father-in-law\u2019s breeding program. Her husband Adam, a PRCA tie-down and team roper, trained Real Deal as a heading horse and Lacinda trained him on barrels.<\/p>\n<p>Adam has qualified for four RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeos and won the Fort Worth Stock Show &amp; Rodeo in January with partner Jett Hillman.<\/p>\n<p>Courtesy of <a
