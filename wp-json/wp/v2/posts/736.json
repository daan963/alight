That\u2019s an awesome horse who has been to the NFR a bunch of times. I dang sure would be excited to draw her again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scheer, after consulting with his doctor, opted not to have surgery.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to my doctor who replaced my other knee, and he told me that the best option would be just to give my (left knee) a break because surgery would only be 70% successful,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cSo, I just gave it five months and my knee feels great.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wore a (knee) brace for three months. The fourth month I took it off and did therapy, and I returned to riding in the fifth month. My therapy was more or less working. I built a horse barn, and I was riding some team roping horses. To me, riding a horse is good therapy because it works your upper body and lower body.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The rodeo hiatus from mid-March to the third week of May because of the COVID-19 pandemic played into Scheer\u2019s favor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hate that there were no rodeos, but it dang-sure helped me and let me heal up,\u201d Scheer said.<\/p>\n<p>Scheer\u2019s first PRCA rodeo back after his injury was the Woodward (Okla.) Elks Rodeo, June 10. He had a 77-point ride on Beutler &amp; Son Rodeo\u2019s Flying Solo.<\/p>\n<p>Scheer is up again at the Jordan (Mont.) Match Xtreme Bronc Ride, June 21. He then will go to the <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/worlds-oldest-rodeo-prescott-live-online\/\">World\u2019s Oldest Rodeo<\/a> in Prescott, Ariz., June 30.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel great,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cI have been running around and I have been chomping at the bit the last month wanting to roll. I was skeptical to see how I would do, but it took me longer to wipe the mold off my chaps than it did to feel good about riding broncs again, so I was happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A year ago, Scheer finished 19th in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $72,813. Scheer finished a career-best second in the 2014 world standings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy plan is to get back to the NFR,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give it my best and hope for the best.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/\">ProRodeo.com<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s good to be back rodeoing again \u2013 especially for Cort Scheer.
