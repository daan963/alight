Globe Life Field (GLF) in Arlington, Texas, will play host to the most celebrated event on the rodeo calendar Dec. 3-12, 2020. Though not everyone will attend the NFR in person this year, they will be able to have their own personal 2D DoppelWrangler in their place!<\/p>\n<p>Organizers are making it possible for fans to have a nearly life-size image seated for the rodeo and possibly even end up on TV! Now through Oct. 31, fans can order a 2D version of themselves (or a loved one) \u2013 known as DoppelWranglers \u2013 to be in attendance for the Wrangler NFR.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting creative and this is going to be a fun way for fans to participate, even if they can&#8217;t be there in person,&#8221; said George Taylor, chief executive officer of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). &#8220;And we&#8217;re helping some very worthy causes at the same time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other sporting events have used this approach to help fans to engage more deeply when they can&#8217;t attend in person. The PRCA and GLF are kicking it up a notch. Three different tiers of<\/p>\n<p>DoppelWranglers can be purchased, with varying benefits at each level and with the proceeds going to fund four great charities.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Fan level DoppelWranglers will be placed randomly throughout the arena. This first option will sell for $100.<\/li>\n<li>The Cowboy DoppelWranglers will allow a cowboy hat to be worn in the image and will be placed randomly. This option is available for $125.<\/li>\n<li>The Gold Buckle DoppelWranglers may include a cowboy hat and will be placed in the most likely televised seating locations during the Wrangler NFR, which will air live on The Cowboy Channel. This option will be available for $200.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To reserve a DoppelWrangler for the 2020 Wrangler NFR, fans need to go to the same portal as for tickets at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/rangers\/fans\/national-finals-rodeo-fan-cutouts\">https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/rangers\/fans\/national-finals-rodeo-fan-cutouts<\/a>. DoppleWranglers must be ordered by Oct. 31, 2020. Proceeds from DoppelWrangler sales will benefit four nonprofit charities: Jr. Rodeo, Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund, Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of the American Cowboy, and the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thankful that Rangers fans and NFR fans can join us at Globe Life Field in person and as DoppelWranglers,&#8221; said Neil Leibman, chief operating officer, Texas Rangers and chairman of the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation Board of Directors. &#8220;The funds raised from the sale of cutouts will make a significant impact on the communities the Rangers Foundation serves and on the work of the Jr. Rodeo, ProRodeo Hall of Fame and the Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jr. Rodeo<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Jr. Rodeo Association is the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association&#8217;s youth program.

After DoppelWranglers are placed, you will receive an email directing you to a webpage where you can see which section your DoppelWrangler is sitting in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I choose my seat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: No, seat assignments are random. We will make our best effort to seat DoppelWranglers from the same order next to each other, but not guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many can I purchase?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Each fan can purchase a maximum of 10 DoppelWranglers per transaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I upload my photo?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: You can upload your photo through the purchase form found at https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/rangers\/fans\/national-finals-rodeo-fan-cutouts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there any restrictions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Yes. The PRCA\/Texas Rangers have the right to refuse any image that includes profanity, political messages, other sports or other teams. The image must be of you, and please do not upload an image of a celebrity. All cutouts will be made the same size and seating locations will be chosen at random.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can two people be in one photo?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: We would prefer one person per photo. If there are two you&#8217;ll have to stand in front of each other \u2013 not next to each other \u2013 and someone may not be fully visible in the seat. Check out our photo guidelines <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/rangers\/fans\/national-finals-rodeo-fan-cutouts\">https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/rangers\/fans\/national-finals-rodeo-fan-cutouts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the difference in base, cowboy hat and premium DoppelWranglers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Base DoppelWranglers are those without cowboy hats in the image and will be placed randomly throughout the ballpark. The Cowboy hat option means a cowboy hat may be worn in the image and will be placed randomly throughout the ballpark. Premium DoppelWranglers may include a cowboy hat and will be placed in the most televised seating locations, but still at random in those sections.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: After the event, can I get my DoppelWrangler shipped to me?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: DoppelWranglers will not be shipped because there is no guarantee on the condition following the 10-day Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.<\/p>\n<p>Courtesy of <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PRCA<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re not going to be at the Wrangler\u00ae National Finals Rodeo (NFR) this year, you can still be there!
