However, as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay anywhere from $70 to $500 per ticket.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of ticket prices for the 2023 NFR:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General public tickets<\/strong>: $70 to $380<\/li>\n<li><strong>Suite tickets<\/strong>: $1,000 to $5,000<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can purchase tickets for the NFR online through the official NFR website, by phone through the NFR ticket office, or from various ticket brokers.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips for getting the best deals on NFR tickets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purchase your tickets in advance<\/strong>.

Many local businesses and organizations offer discounted tickets to the NFR.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_NFR\">Everything You Need to Know About NFR<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Beyond the payouts for the Cowboys, the PRCA estimates that the event brings in about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reviewjournal.com\/sports\/rodeo\/national-finals-rodeo\/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-national-finals-rodeo\/\">$90 million annually to the Las Vegas economy<\/a>. Furthermore, recent attendance stats have shown that\u00a0177,565 rodeo enthusiasts decked out in Wrangler jeans, Justin boots and cowboy hats attended events at the Thomas &amp; Mack with an additional 40,000 fans who watched at the 40 hotels who hosted watch parties. It is during this rare time of the year that many marquees on the Strip have the face of bull riders replace DJs\u2019 faces.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Main_Events\">Main Performance<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Seven main events have historically taken place at the NFR. Each event has its own monetary prizes that are paid out, and those payouts are determined by each top-placing competitor\u2019s rank in relation to the event\u2019s overall prize pool. Individuals placed in the top-six of a particular event are paid out accordingly, while individuals placed in the top-eight of the overall NFR are also paid out. The NFR\u2019s main events are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Bareback_Riding\">Bareback Riding<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This consists of a horseback cowboy using a bareback rigging as the primary means of staying on top of the horse. This grip has often been compared to the equivalent of hanging on to a suitcase handle and makes for the only support that a cowboy has on top of the wildly bucking horse. An 8-second ride constitutes a qualified ride and the cowboys is judged on riding technique.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Steer_Wrestling\">Steer Wrestling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This act involves a horseback steer wrestler, alternatively known as a \u201cbulldogger\u201d, bringing a fast-moving steer to a halt on its back as fast as possible. The bulldogger utilizes a combination of strength, technique, speed, and precision to jump off of their horse from a designated starting point and onto a steer sprinting off from the same starting point.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Team_Roping\">Team Roping<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span id=\"Headers\">Headers<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope the head of the steer in one of three tries as fast as possible; around both horns, around one horn and the head, or around the neck.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4><span id=\"Heelers\">Heelers<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope the hind legs of the steer as soon as the header has successfully done their part. To avoid a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg, the heeler must rope both hind legs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Saddle_Bron_Riding\">Saddle Bron Riding<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Similar to Bareback Riding, the goal of the horseback cowboy is to maintain their balance as much as possible for 8 seconds while the horse is bucking. In this event, however, the cowboy sits on a saddle while using one hand to hold on to a thick rein that\u2019s attached to the horse\u2019s halter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Tie-Down_Roping\">Tie-Down Roping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This event centers around a cowboy on horseback attempting to restrain a calf by throwing a well-timed rope loop that\u2019s attached to the cowboy\u2019s horse. The cowboy and the calf both leave from a designated starting point, with the calf getting a slight head-start. The cowboy depends on the horse to mitigate any slack in the rope after dismounting, then proceeds to tie-up the calf as fast as possible.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Barrel_Racing\">Barrel Racing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is a women\u2019s event where horseback cowgirls race against the clock to complete a strategically set course where barrels are set up as landmarks. The intent is for the cowgirls to complete a cloverleaf-shaped run around 3 barrels placed in a triangular formation as fast as possible. Barrels that are accidentally knocked over result in 5-second penalties.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Bull_Riding\">Bull Riding<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The cowboy on top of the bull has the main objective of staying on top and maintaining their balance for 8 seconds. They are judged based on technique and can earn extra points by spurring while the bull is bucking. The cowboy stays on top of the bull by grasping a flat braided rope, which also wraps around the bull\u2019s chest.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"All-Around_Champion\">All-Around Champion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Being crowned the All-Around Champion speaks volumes about the versatility and high level of talent exhibited by the winning cowboy. \u00a0In order to receive this honor, the cowboy must have won the most prize money in a given year and competed in at least 2 NFR events while earning at least $3,000 in each of those events. This is widely known as the highest honor bestowed by the PRCA.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Contestants\">Contestants<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are 120 cowboys from all over the United States that will step foot as competitors within the NFR.
