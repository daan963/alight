(October 28, 2021) \u2013The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association\u00ae, and Teton Ridge today announced a multi-year deal for Teton Ridge to become the presenting sponsor of the <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/\">NFR Las Vegas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Teton Ridge is a brand dedicated to promoting and preserving iconic western culture.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1985, Las Vegas has played host to the NFR, except for 2020 when the <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/wrangler-nfr-2020-moves-to-globe-life-field-in-arlington-texas\/\">NFR was moved to Arlington<\/a>, Texas, because of COVID-19 restrictions in place in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>The NFR is a culmination of more than 600 PRCA-sanctioned events within the regular season. Las Vegas Events, the special events coordinator for the rodeo, projects 17,000 people in attendance at every performance at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, or 170,000 total. The total estimated economic impact of the NFR was more than $175 million in 2019 according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is great to partner with Teton Ridge as the presenting sponsor of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, the richest and most prestigious rodeo in the world,&#8221; PRCA CEO Tom Glause said. &#8220;It&#8217;s extremely pleasing when you can partner with an organization whose beliefs align with ours. We look forward to this being a great relationship moving forward.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Emphasizing the same commitment to excellence that is exhibited in all Teton Ridge&#8217;s integrations, the dedicated western-preservation brand will place a special focus on elevating the PRCA World Champion crowning ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A PRCA world title received at the NFR is one of the most treasured achievements in rodeo,&#8221; Teton Ridge CEO Jonathan Katz said. &#8220;Celebrating champions and the hard work that goes into rising to the top levels of each rodeo discipline is at the core of Teton Ridge. Aligning with PRCA and LVE as part of this iconic year-end event, we want to join them in honoring western sports and the tremendous professionals competing for world titles in a very prestigious way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The partnership comes on the heels of Teton Ridge&#8217;s recent move to bring The American under the brand&#8217;s umbrella and elevate the richest single-day rodeo in the world to new levels in March 2022 in Arlington, Texas, including an unmatched total purse of more than $3 million, non-stop rodeo action, live music, entertainment and more. The industry-leading event is the centerpiece of the brand&#8217;s western sports portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>Adding the NFR partnership was a natural next step for Teton Ridge and further illustrates the significance placed on celebrating excellence at the top levels of the rodeo world.<\/p>\n<p>For the most comprehensive source for everything ProRodeo year-round and the Wrangler NFR visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/\">prorodeo.com<\/a>.
