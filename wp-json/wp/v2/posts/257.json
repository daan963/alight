You&#8217;ll need to download the Sling TV app once you&#8217;ve chosen a subscription plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is available on smartphones, tablets, Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV streaming devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have never used Sling TV before, consider looking at the Getting Started guide on the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will give you all the information you need to get started, including how to set up your account and choose a subscription package.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step-2-Add-the-Cowboy-Channel\"><\/span>Step 2: Add the Cowboy Channel<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To watch NFR on Sling TV, you will need to add the Cowboy Channel to your package.
