Landingham.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is pretty emotional,\u201d said Landingham, 32. \u201cMy mom, Wendy Skiver, passed away of ovarian cancer (Feb. 3, 2017). This is her rodeo dream, and she is living it with me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Landingham\u2019s mom would have been proud of her son\u2019s performance on Monday night.<\/p>\n<p>Landingham had a 90.5-point ride on Pickett Pro Rodeo\u2019s Top Notch for the win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had been on that horse twice before once before here at the NFR and it didn\u2019t go well because I was battling a shoulder injury,\u201d Landingham said. \u201cThen I had him again in Pecos (Texas) this year and was 87 on him. Tonight, that horse was everything I thought it would be. That\u2019s a big strong horse and he had a great trip, and everything worked out. It is nice to get a round win like this because it pays so well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Landingham earned $28,914 for the victory and has earned $57,723 at the NFR. Landingham is third in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $188,247.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steer wrestler Ty Erickson tops leaderboard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ty Erickson, the 2019 PRCA Steer Wrestling World Champion, was in championship form in Round 5.<\/p>\n<p>Erickson clocked a 3.9-second time to claim the round win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe steer was the one that Hunter Cure won Round 2 on, so I knew he was going to be good,\u201d said Erickson, 32. \u201cHe kind of let up on me a little bit and I knew he was going to be a little slower, but I wasn\u2019t really expecting him to let up like he did. I\u2019m just glad they don\u2019t say pretty run on the paycheck, because it wasn\u2019t a pretty run, but we got him down and the win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Erickson is now fifth in the world standings with $158,823. He has earned $51,039 at this year\u2019s NFR. The Helena, Mont., cowboy was quick to credit his horsepower.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCrush is owned by my wife and myself and he really fits these set ups,\u201d Erickson said. \u201c(He) doesn\u2019t score the best, but when you got to go fast, he\u2019s the one you want to be riding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saddle bronc rider Logan Hay captures first career NFR round win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Logan Hay is making his Wrangler NFR debut quite memorable.<\/p>\n<p>Hay won Round 5 with an 89-point ride on Pete Carr Pro Rodeo\u2019s Larry Culpepper.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLarry\u2019s (Culpepper) a big horse,\u201d Hay said. \u201cHe reminds me a lot of the horse I rode in Calgary this year and he felt similar, so I went with the same game plan. I went with a big spur out and tried to get ahead of him right there and I felt like I accomplished that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hay was trying to digest the moment he was experiencing getting his first NFR round win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really set in yet but being able to take that victory lap was something else,\u201d Hay said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a moment I will remember for the rest of my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hay is fifth in the world standings with $203,226 and he has earned $63,786 at the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to keeping attacking with the same game plan I\u2019ve had the whole week. I\u2019m looking to take it one horse at a time, not try to overthink anything, and just let my riding do what it does.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bull rider Tristen Hutchings gets his second round win of NFR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As NFR debuts go, bull rider Tristen Hutchings is doing great so far.<\/p>\n<p>The Monteview, Idaho, cowboy had a 90.5-point ride on Frontier Rodeo\u2019s County Jail to win Round 5. He also won Round 1 with a 90.5-point ride on Stockyards Pro Rodeo\u2019s Party Animal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually been getting leaned back a little bit,\u201d said Hutchings, 22. \u201cI knew if I stayed on the front end a little bit better, longer, and let my hips get deep that things would work out. I\u2019ve been drawing the right bulls so every time I get them rode they are going to score me high. I might not be first in the average, but I have two go-round buckles, I\u2019m happy to be here, and I\u2019m happy to be healthy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hutchings is glad to see his hard work pay off.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think almost everybody rides better when they are riding into their hand and I knew that I would struggle when I didn\u2019t,\u201d Hutchings said. \u201cI practiced really hard and I\u2019m glad that I did because the only bull I\u2019ve ridden into my hand, I got bucked off. I\u2019ve gotten two knocked down riding away from my hand and that\u2019s not bad when you\u2019re going against the best bucking stock in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hutchings is fourth in the world standings with $198,842. He has earned $70,859 at the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough stretch for the boys in that locker room,\u201d Hutchings said. \u201cWe started with 16 and now we\u2019re down to 14. I got off to a great start and then went through a bumpy patch, so I had my head real low. But I\u2019m excited to get another one rode. It\u2019s tough out here in Vegas. All I can hope for is to just keep getting them rode.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Team ropers Tryan\/Corkill and Proctor\/Medlin share title<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The team roping competition was a split victory.<\/p>\n<p>Coleman Proctor\/Logan Medlin and Clay Tryan\/Jade Corkill shared the win with identical 3.8-second runs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was kind of a blur,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cI saw a pink rope wrap around the horn and my partner (Medlin) pulled him back on his two feet. It all happened in a hurry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Medlin was thrilled with the outcome.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is I wasn\u2019t really nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think we might come out with a go-round win, but I wasn\u2019t really nervous before we rode. I\u2019m just glad I went out there and did my job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tryan acknowledged nothing came easy on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a tough night against this field of guys,\u201d Tryan said. \u201cThe quick times got off to a hurry, so we knew it was going to be a night where we needed to be aggressive. We just made a solid run with a good start and a clean, solid finish.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Corkill loves the opportunity to compete for big money at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust the chance to compete for $30,000 each night is what makes me excited,\u201d Corkill said. \u201cWe have five more nights with a good chance to capture more money before it\u2019s all said and done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tie-down ropers Marty Yates, Kincade Henry share Round 5 crown<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The veteran \u2013 Marty Yates \u2013 and newcomer Kincade Henry shared the spotlight in tie-down roping.<\/p>\n<p>They had identical 7.3-second runs to claim the Round 5 win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOh man, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s so cool,\u201d said Henry, 20. \u201cThis is my first time here and it just\u00a0happens so fast I am just happy I got her done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Henry has moved up to fifth in the world standings with $188,194. He has earned $86,248 at the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>Yates, 28, is making his ninth-consecutive appearance at the NFR and won Round 4 with a 7.4-second run.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMan, it\u2019s awesome to finally get back on the right end of things,\u201d Yates said. \u201cI got a great start; my horse did great tonight. So, it\u2019s nice to be on the winning side of things, always.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barrel racers Hailey Kinsel, Lisa Lockhart share Round 5 glory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hailey Kinsel made it three round wins out of five, winning Round 5 with a 13.52-second run. Kinsel added the Round 5 victory to her Round 2 (13.61 seconds) and Round 3 (13.59 seconds) wins.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, Kinsel split the Round 5 win with Lockhart as each had 13.52 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s special here. Las Vegas and the Thomas &amp; Mack Arena have their own unique energy that you remember, and you want to get back to,\u201d Kinsel said. \u201cTo come back and be able to do well again, it\u2019s awesome. This rodeo is so tough. This field of barrel racers is one of the toughest you\u2019ll see. I\u2019m just thrilled to have the success that we are because nothing is guaranteed when you\u2019re here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kinsel took a moment to talk about the preparation she and her star horse Sister go through.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen her and I were younger, there was definitely more practicing involved with the setup and trying to get the pattern down,\u201d Kinsel said. \u201cAfter we\u2019ve been here a couple of times, I\u2019ve decided not to overwork her now and really just trust the process of my horse and trust her skill. She seems happy and it appears to be working.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lockhart, a veteran of 16 NFRs, discussed the horsepower she is using.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m riding a young horse and he\u2019s gotten stronger every night. We broke the ice in Round 2 and have continued to place higher each night. My job was really to get him to his spot and once he did, I thought, \u2018well, here we go,\u2019 because that first barrel is crucial here. That really makes a difference.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery horse is a little different. Some take right to it while mine has been hesitant and a little bit scared of everything. There\u2019s a lot of energy in the arena so I commend him for having the focus he\u2019s had because there are a lot of distractions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-1st-go-round-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 1st go-round results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-round-2-results-highlights\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Round 2 Results &amp; Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-3rd-go-round-highlights-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 3rd go-round highlights &amp; results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-4th-go-round-highlights-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 4th go-round highlights &amp; results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>2022 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Results<br \/>\nRound 5, Dec. 5<br \/>\nThomas &amp; Mack Center, Las Vegas, Nev.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bareback Riding: <\/strong>Fifth round: 1.
