I just hope to use everything I\u2019ve learned when I go back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This season has been bizarre to say the least with rodeos stopping in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic and then restarting the third week of May.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the stop and start to the season, Brunner has worked his way to eighth in the June 16 PRCA | RAM World Standings with $26,235. He moved up five spots in the latest standings, thanks to splitting wins at the Woodward (Okla.) Elks Rodeo and the Coleman (Texas) PRCA Rodeo. Both ended June 13.<\/p>\n<p>Brunner had a 3.8-second run in Woodward and earned $3,266 by tying with Trell Etbauer. He stopped the clock in 3.7 seconds in Coleman and earned $1,925 after splitting the victory with Gabe Soileau.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a good feeling to do that well,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cIt was good to kick things off and get things rolling again. I wish I could go to rodeos everyday when I\u2019m on a roll like that. I had a couple of good steers at Woodward and Coleman, and I just tried to do my job and make good runs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brunner rode Miss Kitty, 13, in Coleman and Woodward. Cole Edge, riding Slick, was Brunner&#8217;s hazer during both runs.<\/p>\n<p>When rodeos were on hiatus, Brunner kept busy working for his family in Ramona, Kan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a family operation, and I just tried to help out,\u201d the 6-foot-2, 230-pound Brunner said. \u201cI practiced a little bit, took some time off and let my horses take some time off. When things looked like they were going to get going again, I started practicing and getting my horses back in shape, but I enjoyed my time at home for sure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brunner\u2019s family has a feedlot and a farm, and his uncle has a cow-calf operation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was ready to go to some rodeos,\u201d Brunner said.<\/p>\n<p>Up next for Brunner is the <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/worlds-oldest-rodeo-prescott-live-online\/\">World\u2019s Oldest Rodeo<\/a> in Prescott, Ariz., June 29.
