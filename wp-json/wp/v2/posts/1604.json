You know I had a really good calf tonight, so it made my job easy, you know I\u2019ve rode two different horses so far, so hopefully it\u2019s headed back in my direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yates was guided to victory by his horse Jag.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the horse that I\u2019ve owned for a couple of years now. I\u2019ve actually won all my money throughout the regular season on it. So, I sure know every move he\u2019s going to make, so I have a lot of confidence in him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yates, who finished second in the 2020 world standings, has a simple plan for the remainder of the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne swing, one wrap and a victory lap, every night that\u2019s what we\u2019re after,\u201d Yates said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bull rider Stetson Wright wins another round in bull riding<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stetson Wright continues to bask in the spotlight at the Wrangler NFR.<\/p>\n<p>The Utah cowboy had a 92-point ride on Salt River Rodeo\u2019s Belly Dump to take the Round 4 win. Wright also won Round 2 with an 88-point trip on Dakota Rodeo\u2019s Pookie Holler.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a really good bull,\u201d Wright said. \u201cHe had me rocked back there because he bucked up so high. I just kept trying to fight it, there was a lot going on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Getting bucked off in Round 3 did give Wright a jolt before Round 4.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was more focused on letting myself know that I can\u2019t let off the gas,\u201d Wright said. \u201c(Saturday night), I let it slip away so tonight I wanted to come back and redeem myself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some might think competing in saddle bronc riding and bull riding at the NFR would be a grind, but Wright does not view things that way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI actually like it more at the NFR than any other rodeo because it\u2019s such a fast-paced rodeo,\u201d Wright said about competing in two events. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to think, and you don\u2019t have time to get tired. You\u2019re just going, going, going. That\u2019s one thing I like about it and wish every rodeo was like that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wright leads the all-around standings with ($505,834) and bull riding ($413,842) and second in saddle bronc riding with $248,123.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cole Reiner nabs first career round win in Vegas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bareback rider Cole Reiner won Round 6 and Round 9 at the 2020 Wrangler NFR in Arlington, Texas. He had never captured glory at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas \u2013 until Sunday night.<\/p>\n<p>Reiner won Round 4 with an 89-point ride on Sankey ProRodeo &amp; Phenom Genetics\u2019 Southlands Shoutin\u2019 Shoes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was on that horse before, and I was 88 points a few years ago on that horse in Rapid City, S.D.,\u201d said Reiner, 23. \u201cWade Sankey is a great stock contractor and he put a halter on him and if that was probably his best trip he has ever had right there so I was very thankful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And he was thrilled to celebrate in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very excited to get my first round win here (at the Thomas &amp; Mack),\u201d Reiner said. \u201cMoving forward, I need to mark my horse out (Monday night) it is as simple as that. This is nothing to get ahead of myself about. I don\u2019t know what I have (Monday), and it doesn\u2019t matter. I need a strong mark out first jump and spur and that is the same goal every time out and hopefully I will have the same outcome.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steer wrestler Hunter Cure strikes again<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hunter Cure, a two-time PRCA Steer Wrestling World Champion in 2013 and 2015, is displaying his championship form at the 2022 NFR.<\/p>\n<p>The Texas cowboy won Round 2 with a 3.7-second run and added a Round 4 win in 3.9 seconds on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I have been amped up like at my first NFR, then I tried to calm down, but it\u2019s just finding the balance of being up and down and making it work!,\u201d said Cure, 39.<\/p>\n<p>Cure has moved up from fifth to second in the world standings with $177,357 and he has earned $67,827 at the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat steer Stetson Jorgensen won second earlier, that steer handled exceptionally, I felt like I broke out honestly, but this is the only rodeo in the world where if you think you broke out, kick two more times and get down on your steer,\u201d Cure said. \u201cRingo is not as seasoned here in Las Vegas, but I really feel that he\u2019ll develop into a great horse in years to come\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Team ropers Tyler Wade\/Trey Yates snare Round 4 glory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Team ropers Tyler Wade\/Trey Yates are veterans of the Wrangler NFR and they used their experience to their benefit on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>Wade and Yates clocked a 3.9-second run to claim the Round 4 title.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a good steer. I saw him handle it well so I knew I was going to give Trey a chance to go fast and he did,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHe cleaned up and it came together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yates concurred with his partner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve roped so many steers together and practiced for many scenarios,\u201d Yates said. \u201cI have full confidence (in him) no matter where we go. With a setup like this, he\u2019s studied it so much. He\u2019s been so in tune the last month that I knew he had a good chance to turn all ten. I messed up in Round 1 but I knew with him we would be able to bounce back and have a chance to win a lot of rounds together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wade, like so many of the team ropers, spends plenty of time studying to help make the perfect run.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnybody that gets here knows the game really well, I\u2019m going to bet,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut, I continue to be a student of the game. This is my fifth year here and being able to learn from my own mistakes is the biggest thing for me to bounce back faster.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saddle bronc rider Zeke Thurston takes Round 4 crown<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Zeke Thurston knows how to win at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas \u2013 he won PRCA Saddle Bronc Riding World Championships in 2016 and 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Thurston was back to his winning ways on Sunday, grabbing the Round 4 crown with an 88.5-point ride on Championship Pro Rodeo\u2019s Heaven on Earth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was unridden, but I figured, you know, they are all going to get ridden at some point so why not be the guy,\u201d Thurston said. \u201cReally big, strong stud horse that bucked hard. I was able to get ahead of her and luckily, I stayed on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thurston is fourth in the world standings with $222,547 and has won an event-best $78,709 so far at the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. You just have to go at every one and do the best that you can. Some days you\u2019re going to have the horse and some days you\u2019re not. But if you go at them all the same, it usually works out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, my biggest confidence comes from my spur outs, and I was really confident in them. On a horse like that, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to thrive. I always go with that and win, lose, or draw, we\u2019re going to start the process all over again the next day. So, you might as well lay it all out there and see what you get.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barrel racer Emily Beisel takes victory lap after Round 4<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Barrel racer Emily Beisel was doing anything to change her luck in Round 4 after back-to-back runs north of 18 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Beisel\u2019s luck changed in a big way as she won Round 4 with a 13.60-second time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Anytime you get to come down here and see (the media) it is always a huge blessing because it\u2019s tough,\u201d Beisel said. \u201cEvery night in barrel racing is a knife fight. But I\u2019m so thankful for my horse. He\u2019s been working so hard for me. I felt like the first couple of nights I was trying to cut corners a little too fast. Tonight, I gave him a little more room and he made it happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then Beisel talked about how she tried to change her fortunes in Round 4.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe brought out all the good luck tonight,\u201d Beisel said. \u201cMy husband is here and usually when he shows up things get better for me. My friend, Jimmie Smith, sent me an NFR goodie package before we left, and they included the socks that she wore when she won the round in Arlington, so I had those on tonight as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-1st-go-round-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 1st go-round results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-round-2-results-highlights\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Round 2 Results &amp; Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/2022-wrangler-nfr-las-vegas-3rd-go-round-highlights-results\/\">2022 Wrangler NFR Las Vegas 3rd go-round highlights &amp; results<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>2022 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Results<br \/>\nRound 4, Dec. 4th<br \/>\nThomas &amp; Mack Center, Las Vegas, Nev.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bareback Riding: <\/strong>Fourth round: 1.
