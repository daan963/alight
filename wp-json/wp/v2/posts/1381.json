Add Wednesday night to his list of great accomplishments. Wright rode three bulls in less than 15 minutes and then won Round 7 on his second re-ride bull. The Milford, Utah, cowboy had a 90.5-point ride on Pete Carr Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Bloomer&#8217;s High Rise. &#8220;The pain is going to go away and especially after the tenth round is up, so I figured I&#8217;d put everything on the line,&#8221; said the exhausted Wright. &#8220;I risked getting every bone in my body broke to win and right now it&#8217;s going good, but we have a few more to go.&#8221; Wright, 22, said he never been on three bulls in one rodeo at the PRCA level. Wright earned $46,374, counting ground money, since he and Josh Frost were the only two cowboys to make the whistle in Round 7. Frost, who had a 52.5-point ride on Beutler &amp; Son Rodeo&#8217;s Record Rack&#8217;s Viper, earned $40,713.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STETSON WRIGHT CLOSING IN ON THIRD CONSECUTIVE ALL-AROUND TITLE<\/strong><br \/>\nStetson Wright has all but locked up his third straight PRCA All-Around World Championship headed into Round 8 of the 2021 Wrangler NFR.

With three nights left to go at the Finals, the Milford, Utah, cowboy has a $254,331 lead over tie-down roper Caleb Smidt for the top spot. Wright has won $467,197 so far this season in saddle bronc riding and bull riding. Stetson now has his sights set on breaking Trevor Brazile&#8217;s PRCA all-time single season earnings record of $518,011, which was set in 2015. He will have six more outs to try and set the all-time mark. His run at this year&#8217;s NFR is highlighted by a 94.5-point bull ride on Powder River Rodeo&#8217;s Chiseled in Round 5. He has two second place finishes in saddle bronc riding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NEWS &amp; NOTES<\/strong><br \/>\nIn bareback riding, five-time PRCA World Champion <strong>Kaycee Feild<\/strong>\u00a0looks to make a strong final push, matching up with Hi Lo Pro Rodeo&#8217;s High Heels. The horse was awarded the bareback horse of the night after bucking off\u00a0<strong>Caleb Bennett <\/strong>in Round 3. Feild currently holds an $11,550 lead over\u00a0<strong>Jess Pope<\/strong>, the current leader in the average. Bennett will aim to build off his 86-point ride Wednesday night, drawing Calgary Stampede&#8217;s Soap Bubbles. The nine-time NFR qualifier has only found the pay window once thus far. Soap Bubbles will make his 2021 Wrangler NFR debut Thursday, entering with an average stock score of 44.18 and seven qualified rides.\u2026In the saddle bronc riding, two-time PRCA World Champion <strong>Zeke Thurston<\/strong> has a favorable matchup in Round 8. He has drawn Bridwell Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Indian Burn. In nine outs this season, only three cowboys have lasted the eight seconds. <strong>Layton Green<\/strong> had a 91-point ride on the horse at ProRodeo Tour Finale in Salinas, Calif., Sept. 26. <strong>Spencer Wright<\/strong> will look to continue his solid Wrangler NFR on Thursday night, when he matches up with Beutler &amp; Son Rodeo&#8217;s Nutrena&#8217;s Killer Bee. Wright is sitting second in the average and will try to cover a horse that has yet to have an out at this year&#8217;s Finals\u2026In the bull riding, <strong>Josh Frost<\/strong> will look to build off his second-place finish last night. In Round 8, he&#8217;s drawn Four Star Rodeo&#8217;s Shark Bait. The bull has bucked off 83 percent of would-be riders in 2021. The only cowboy to cover Shark Bait this season is the world&#8217;s No.1 man <strong>Sage Kimzey<\/strong>.
