We think it&#8217;s important to remember how far we&#8217;ve come so that we can appreciate where we are now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back in time and look at the history of the National Finals Rodeo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What-is-the-National-Finals-Rodeo\"><\/span>What is the National Finals Rodeo?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great to know that the National Finals Rodeo is widely recognized as the most famous Rodeo in the world! It&#8217;s the exciting Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association&#8217;s title event to wrap up the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing that since 1985, the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas has hosted an event every December!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Finals Rodeo is a fun event where the top 15 riders in steer wrestling, team roping (headers and heelers), saddle bronc riding, tie-down rope, barrel racing, and bull riding get to show off their skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many bull riders, this is a great way to make money during the regular season at events like the ProRodeo Tour, the Justin Playoffs, and the PRCA Xtreme Bulls Tour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is an exciting event where the world&#8217;s best Rodeo athletes compete for the world champion title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The winners are chosen based on their impressive earnings throughout the season, including what they won at the NFR and before. It&#8217;s a thrilling competition showcasing these athletes&#8217; incredible talent and dedication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How-Does-the-National-Finals-Rodeo-Work\"><\/span>How Does the National Finals Rodeo Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Finals consist of a series of 10 matches that are spread out over a period of 10 days. Rodeo competitors can earn cash awards for their performance in various rounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, those who place within the top seven in any given round and within the top eight in the overall average, which is determined by the overall time or points earned over the course of 10 rounds, are eligible for a cash prize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After each NFR, two outstanding individuals are recognized in each event: the average winner, who achieved the highest ongoing time or score for that event over the 10 rounds and won the NFR, and the world champion, who earned the most money throughout the year (including their earnings at the NFR).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world champion and the overall winner might vary for each event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"History-of-the-National-Finals-Rodeo\"><\/span>History of the National Finals Rodeo<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Excitingly, the top fifteen money-winners in each event get to compete for the world title at the National Finals Rodeo!
