Sure, the stock you&#8217;re assigned to ride or rope or wrestle is key. The order in which you compete can be a factor.<\/p>\n<p>And for multi-day rodeos, the day you compete can make a big difference. Tie-down roper <strong>Ty Harris<\/strong> can vouch for that.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday morning at the Sisters (Ore.) Rodeo, Harris made his two runs. The first was a relatively nondescript 10.0-second effort. Harris was significantly faster catching his second calf, a solid 8.6-second effort.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The first round, I had to run my calf a little bit,&#8221; said Harris, 24. &#8220;The second round, I had a great calf. I didn&#8217;t get in the way of myself, and I got a good time. It worked out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But there were still several good cowboys awaiting their two rounds, competing Friday, Saturday or Sunday. So Harris tempered his expectations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After I rode out of the arena, I told my dad I was probably gonna win fourth in the average, with the quality of the ropers still competing \u2013 a good field and good calves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know the weather was gonna be bad.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, Thursday&#8217;s contestants got the better of Mother Nature during the four-day rodeo.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It rained the next three days, when everybody else roped. I was fortunate to get to rope in good conditions,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;Rodeo doesn&#8217;t get canceled or delayed. No matter what the weather, rodeo happens.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the end, Harris&#8217; first-round run was good for a seventh-place tie and a modest $346. His stronger second-round run was good for a fourth-place tie and another $1,400 or so. And when both runs were added up, well, he wasn&#8217;t fourth in the average. Rather, he was first with a total time of 18.6 seconds, nearly a second ahead of second-place <strong>Jared Parke<\/strong> (19.4).<\/p>\n<p>That led to another $3,410 for a total cash out of more than $5,100. As such, the three-time <a href=\"https:\/\/portal-alpha.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\/\">Wrangler NFR<\/a> qualifier stayed well on track for a fourth straight Vegas trip. Harris is currently seventh in the tie-down world standings, with $51,777 so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is by far the best start I&#8217;ve ever had. It feels really good. I&#8217;ve been blessed to run a lot of great calves in the winter and spring,&#8221; he said, before giving a deserved nod to his trusty steed, Spiderman. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a horse that puts me in position to win every time I&#8217;m in the box. I feel very confident, because I know what he&#8217;s gonna do.<br \/>\n&#8220;I just need to keep getting out of the barrier good, roping the neck, giving myself chances.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other winners at the $167,094 rodeo were all-around cowboy<strong> Jared Parke<\/strong> ($4,052, tie-down roping and team roping); bareback rider <strong>Keenan Hayes<\/strong> (85.5 points on Flying 5 Rodeo&#8217;s Miss Major); steer wrestler <strong>Jace Melvin<\/strong> (10.5 seconds on two head); team ropers <strong>Jake Cooper<\/strong>\/<strong>Sid Sporer<\/strong> and <strong>Rhen Richard<\/strong>\/<strong>Jeremy Buhler<\/strong> (5.0 seconds); saddle bronc rider <strong>CoBurn Bradshaw<\/strong> (*89.5 points on Flying 5 Rodeo&#8217;s Spring Plantin); barrel racer <strong>Taycie Matthews<\/strong> (17.73 seconds); breakaway roper<strong> Samantha Fulton<\/strong> (2.7 seconds); and bull rider<strong> Ky Hamilton<\/strong> (88.5 points on Corey &amp; Lange Rodeo&#8217;s Billy Hell). * Arena Record<\/p>\n<p>Courtesy of PRCA: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/news\/2022\/6\/12\/general-ty-harris-continues-nfr-quest-with-sisters-ore-win\">Main articles<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the world of rodeo, luck of the draw works in multiple ways.
