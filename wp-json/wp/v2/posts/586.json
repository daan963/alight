When he walks in there, he has a nice reminder of the success that he has had as a PRCA team roping header.<\/p>\n<p>He has qualified for his 12th consecutive Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 10th place with $84,939 earned during the regular season. His previous 11 back numbers are all framed and hung on the wall. And while he lives in Texas now, South Carolina will always be home. He\u2019ll be proud to carry the \u201cPalmetto State\u201d flag during the grand entry for 10 nights in Vegas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Professional<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>2019 Highlights<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Won the Oakdale (Calif.)

The first was in 2016 with Dakota Kirchenschlager. He missed it in 2017 finishing the season in 28th. Then he made it back again in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The first year he was there he didn\u2019t really know what to expect and no matter what anyone told him, experiencing it for himself was a different reality. He saw what other ropers did to prepare and tried to mimic that. It wasn\u2019t the best plan. He and Dakota placed in four rounds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Professional<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Billie Jack Saebens<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Won the 101 Wild West Rodeo (Ponca City, Okla.)<br \/>\n\u2022 Won the Cowboy Country Fest (Shawnee, Okla.)<br \/>\n\u2022 Won the Rooftop Rodeo (Estes Park, Colo.)<br \/>\n\u2022 Co-champion at the Gooding (Idaho) Pro Rodeo<br \/>\n\u2022 Co-champion at the Lawton (Okla.)

He knows all about near misses as well after finishing last year in 18th place.<\/p>\n<p>Now he knows what it is like to qualify for rodeo\u2019s championships near the top of the list and to be able to pick and choose which fall rodeos he wants to compete at. That happened this year thanks in part to a big win he and partner Ryan Motes had at RFD-TV\u2019s The American last March.<\/p>\n<p>That $50,000 that he won there had him in second place in the world standings the first of April with over $90,000 in earnings. That is a position he had never been in before. He continued picking up checks with Ryan and other partners to the tune of $104,318 earned in the regular season.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Professional<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>2019 Highlights- Partner Ryan Motes<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Won The American (Arlington, Texas)<br \/>\n\u2022 Won the Lea County PRCA Rodeo (Lovington, N.M.)<br \/>\n\u2022 Won the Tri-State Rodeo Cinch Shoot-Out (Fort Madison, Iowa)<br \/>\n\u2022 Co-champion at the Lawton (Okla.)

When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the timer. In conjunction with the Wrangler\u00ae National Finals Rodeo (NFR) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, women ropers will compete for the 2020 world championship: The <a
