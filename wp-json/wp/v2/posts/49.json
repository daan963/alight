Here are the events that will be a part of the Junior World Finals Rodeo (JWFR2k23):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bareback Riding:<\/strong> An event where young riders use rigging to hold onto and try to ride a bucking horse without a saddle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saddle Bronc Riding:<\/strong> Similar to bareback riding, saddle bronc riding is about riding a bucking horse with a saddle that provides better control and stability to the rider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bull Riding:<\/strong> In this event, the rider must attempt to balance on a bucking bull for 8 seconds using one hand on a rope tied to the bull.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barrel Racing:<\/strong> It is a timed event where the rider must ride a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels as quickly as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Steer Wrestling:<\/strong> This event involves the rider jumping off their horse and wrestling a steer to the ground as fast as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Team Roping:<\/strong> Two riders are paired to rope a steer in this event. One is tasked with roping the steer\u2019s head, and the other focuses on roping its hind legs. Like Steer Wrestling, they must attempt the task quickly in this event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breakaway Roping:<\/strong> In this event, the rider ropes a calf and quickly releases the rope without \u201cbreaking\u201d the calf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goat Tying:<\/strong> This event mainly focuses on the rider dismounting from the horse, approaching a tethered goat, and tying it within the fastest time possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pole Bending:<\/strong> Pole bending is an equestrian sport in which a horse and rider must pass through six poles twice, one after the other. The poles are usually 21 feet apart from each other. However, the rider must complete the course of the event without knocking the poles. The challenge becomes more difficult for the rider when they are tasked to finish the course as fast as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the popular nine rodeo events that will be a part of the Junior World Finals Rodeo 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When-Did-the-Junior-World-Finals-Begin-for-the-First-Time\"><\/span>When Did the Junior World Finals Begin for the First Time?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Junior World Finals Rodeo (JWFR) began in 2013 and became a new rodeo edition.
