They add movement and a touch of flair to any outfit, whether you\u2019re in the stands or on the street.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embroidered Denim<\/strong>: Denim is a staple in Western wear.

Use a bandana or a wild rag as a necktie, headband, or purse accessory.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vest or Waistcoat<\/strong>: Add a layer of sophistication to your NFR wardrobe with a vest or waistcoat. Leather, suede, or a patterned fabric can add depth to your outfit.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Styling-Tips\"><\/span>Styling Tips<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mix and match textures:<\/strong> Combine leather, denim, and cotton for a dynamic look.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t be afraid of color:<\/strong> While earth tones are classic, vibrant colors can make your outfit stand out.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fit is key:<\/strong> Ensure your pieces fit well.
