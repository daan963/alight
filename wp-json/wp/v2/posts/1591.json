To cross that $2 million dollar mark, it\u2019s special,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. When I hear something like that, it makes me emotional. I\u2019m the luckiest guy on the planet and I can\u2019t be thankful enough for how these last four years have gone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wright, who joined the PRCA in 2018, has won five world titles \u2013 three in all-around (2019-21) and one in bull riding (2020) and one in saddle bronc riding (2021).<\/p>\n<p>Wright earned $49,666 with his bull riding victory and $7,462 by placing fifth in saddle bronc riding with his 85-point ride on Stace Smith Pro Rodeo\u2019s Cancun Moon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good bull, he\u2019s an awkward build and bucking bull so you have to ride him really funky,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to ride a bull the way I rode him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt gives you a lot of momentum and the confidence is everything. This was the eliminator pen for us. For Ky (Hamilton, who had a 77-point ride) and me to ride these top-ranked bulls, it gives you the thought that \u2018you should be able to ride all of the bulls.\u2019 Right now, I feel 10-feet tall and bulletproof. I\u2019m sure Ky feels the same way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tie-down roper Caleb Smidt makes it two in a row<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tie-down roper Caleb Smidt keeps on winning. After capturing Round 1 with a 7.5-second run he added the Round 2 victory with an even quicker 7.2-second run.<\/p>\n<p>In two nights, Smidt has earned $57,827 and is second in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $217,343. He trails leader Shad Mayfield by $19,016.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s truly no words to describe it, there\u2019s no other feeling like it,\u201d said Smidt about his winning ways.<\/p>\n<p>After winning Round 1, Smidt was able to slow everything down.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just came back tonight and did my job, I tried not to think too much about it,\u201d said Smidt, 33.<\/p>\n<p>Smidt was to the point when talking about his game plan for the remainder of the NFR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do the same thing I did the last two nights,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I keep having fun and keep my steps simple, it\u2019ll be a lot of fun here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bareback rider Leighton Berry gets first career NFR round win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the 2020 Wrangler NFR, Leighton Berry was on the cusp of a round win placing second three times.<\/p>\n<p>Berry doesn\u2019t have to wait any longer for NFR glory.<\/p>\n<p>The Weatherford, Texas, cowboy had an 86.5-point ride on Pickett Pro Rodeo\u2019s Top Egyptian to win Round 2.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMan, it feels like a weight lifted off my shoulders,\u201d said Berry, 23. \u201cI won second in Round 2, 3 and 4 in Arlington (Texas, at the 2020 Wrangler NFR) and I have just been craving to get one of those buckles and to finally have one means the world to me. It feels great to win (a round in Las Vegas). I have been dreaming of this since I was a little kid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Berry was no stranger to Top Egyptian.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny is I was first out on the San Angelo (Texas) Chute-Out (in April) on that horse, and I thought I made an even better ride then and I was only 86,\u201d Berry said. \u201cThat horse is phenomenal. Cullen Pickett, I can\u2019t say enough about him, he raises such great bucking horses and takes time with them. Every time I have one by my name, I get full of jitters. I love getting on Cullen Pickett bucking horses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Veteran steer wrestler Hunter Cure grabs Round 2 victory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Steer wrestler Hunter Cure is no stranger to NFR success as he has walked away with PRCA World Championships in 2015 and 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Cure, of Holliday, Texas, returned to the Wrangler NFR for the first time since 2019 and was taking a victory lap after Round 2 with a 3.7-second time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI got such an aggressive start, I felt like I broke out and at most rodeos, I would have,\u201d said Cure, a six-time NFR qualifier in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2018-19. \u201cThe steer got out fast and really didn\u2019t have a chance to build up a lot of speed, so he didn\u2019t handle it as well as some of the others, but it worked and first is first and now on to the next one.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cure, a savvy veteran, believes he now has his emotions in check.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first round always seems to get to me, not sure what it is but otherwise, nerves aren\u2019t an issue,\u201d Cure said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saddle bronc rider Lefty Holman captures first career round win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The charismatic Lefty Holman couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face.<\/p>\n<p>The Visalia, Calif., cowboy was grinning ear-to-ear after winning Round 2 with an 87-point ride on Four Star Rodeo\u2019s Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt truly is the best feeling in the world,\u201d Holman said. \u201cWhen you work so hard to get here and then you are able to succeed here, it\u2019s the best. I\u2019m blessed with a great support system and super grateful for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Holman was riding Wall Street for the third time which helped his cause.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a California buckin\u2019 horse. It\u2019s a cool deal that is going on and definitely a win I will never forget,\u201d Holman said.<\/p>\n<p>Holman made his NFR debut in 2022 in Arlington, Texas, and he was thrilled to be in the yellow bucking chutes in Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is just right on top of you. The energy in there is something that I\u2019ve never felt,\u201d Holman said. \u201cMy heart was pounding when I got off. I looked up and my parents were hollering. It just feels like there\u2019s people breathing down your neck. It\u2019s the craziest feeling in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Team ropers Smith\/Long top Round 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Team roping header Clay Smith broke his right leg on June 28, but he was bound and determined to qualify for the Wrangler NFR with his then recently acquired partner Jake Long.<\/p>\n<p>That mission was accomplished and on Thursday the duo added a Round 2 win to their accolades.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. Good to catch one. There\u2019s enough money to where every round means something so it\u2019s good to get it started,\u201d Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>Long is thrilled to be teamed up with Smith, a two-time world champ in 2018 and 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I think a great header like him (Clay Smith) isn\u2019t going to miss very often,\u201d Long said. \u201cI was as shocked as anybody when that first one (rope) didn\u2019t stay on (in Round 1). I wasn\u2019t very worried about it happening too often.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After an injury-riddled regular season, Smith pointed out the reasons to his late-season surge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had a horse that really helped and Jake that didn\u2019t mess up so that was the key,\u201d Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>Long, a 12-time NFR qualifier, is excited to be roping in the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s always fit me because I like to be aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a heeler, it\u2019s about getting out there and getting to your spot fast enough. To get into a spot where you can do it fast enough without affecting the steer, that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smith has mapped out a strategy moving forward.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about. I\u2019m going to try my best to give him something to win on the 10th round because since I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s always come down to the last steer,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be pretty aggressive from here on out. I\u2019m just hoping I set him up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barrel racer Hailey Kinsel takes Round 2 victory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Barrel racer Hailey Kinsel flexed her muscles with a 13.61-second run to take the Round 2 crown.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a great crowd on a Friday night at the Thomas &amp; Mack. I just changed a couple of things about my approach into the first barrel and everything else stayed just about the same. We got in the flow, and it felt good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The margins in barrel racing are razor thin so she made adjustments for Round 2.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt does just a tiny bit. It feels enough out-of-whack that you have to jump over an additional hump. Luckily, we smoothed that out tonight. My horse (Sister) is so fast and she allowed me not to make many mistakes. She pushes me to be better every night.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s special, it\u2019s tiny, and it\u2019s a lot of energy packed into one little place. It\u2019s a rush like you\u2019d never feel anywhere else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bull rider Reid Oftedahl suffers injury in Round 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bull rider Reid Oftedahl was injured during Round 2 while aboard Rafter H Rodeo Livestock\u2019s Under the Influence.
