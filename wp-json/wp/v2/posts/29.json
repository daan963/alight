Barrel racing attracts the crowd because of its quick turns, high speeds, and edge-of-your-seat excitement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early days, the racing pattern of the horse and rider often alternated between a figure eight and a cloverleaf pattern, but the pattern changed in 1948 when the Women\u2019s Professional Rodeo Association &#8211; WPRA established barrel racing as a timed event and implemented the cloverleaf as the official pattern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who-Can-Participate-in-the-Race\"><\/span>Who Can Participate in the Race?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At amateur or youth levels, both females and males can compete. But this event is fully reserved for females in the collegiate and even the professional ranks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting factor about Barrel racing is it combines the horse&#8217;s athletic ability and the rider&#8217;s horsemanship skills to run around the three barrels without any injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those three barrels used for barrel racing in the NFR rodeo competition are normally in a triangle pattern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How-is-the-Winner-Selected\"><\/span>How is the Winner Selected?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rider who can quickly take up the barrel course is the winner. A laser system electric device called the electric eye is used to measure the time. Even in the armature events, a judge is assigned to test the time, who drops a flag to alert the timekeeper when to start or stop the clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock starts when the horse rider crosses the starting line and stops when the rider has arrived at all the barrel patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Common-Rules-of-Barrel-Racing\"><\/span>Common Rules of Barrel Racing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of rules are applied for both armature and professional barrel racing events. Those are given below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The fastest rider wins.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rider must ride around all three patterns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A five-second penalty will be if any rider\u2019s horse hits or knocks over a barrel.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Within the course of sixty seconds, the ride needs to be done.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>None of the riders can start the run from the off-center alleyway.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The arena has to be changed or repaired after every twelve contestants\/riders run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Final-Words\"><\/span>Final Words<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Barrel racing is a rodeo event for female horse riders. Starting in the 1930s till today, it is one of the most fascinating rodeo events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the event had seen 173,350 attendees in the competition&#8217;s ten days and sold out more than 350 consecutive performances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the event will take place at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas on 7-16 December. We await to watch the race and know this year&#8217;s increased audience to sold-out numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the event had a total attendance of 173,350 over the 10 days of competition at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center and has sold out more than 350 consecutive performances in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Considered the wealthiest and most prestigious rodeo chapters in the world, the Wrangler NRF attracts the top 15 athletes in bareback riding, steer wrestling, team roping, saddle bronc riding, tie-down roping, barrel racing, and bull riding events to compete.
