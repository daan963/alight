The primary horse Hanchey was aboard all season \u2013 TJ \u2013 passed away. The horse was owned by\u00a0Logan Bird. Hanchey said the loss wouldn&#8217;t set him back at the Wrangler NFR and it didn&#8217;t \u2013 at least for Round 1. The Sulphur, La., native clocked a 7.4-second run to win the round before 16,804 fans at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. &#8220;That run was so much more than a round win, with me losing TJ, 10 days ago and he was what I was planning on riding at the Finals, so I really wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to do,&#8221; Hanchey said. Hanchey, the 2013 world champion, leads the world standings with $212,076. He earned $26,997 for the victory. However, Hanchey had his doubts about getting on Peso. &#8220;I said Logan, he&#8217;s never been there, and Logan said, &#8216;you have to trust me&#8217;,&#8221; Hanchey said. &#8220;I put my trust in him and the man upstairs and it paid off.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>EARNINGS STARTED EARLY FOR WRANGLER NFR CONTESTANTS<\/strong><br \/>\nAt the 63rd Wrangler National Finals Rodeo presented by Teton Ridge, each of the 119 qualifiers received a $10,000 stipend for qualifying for the NFR. <strong>Stetson Wright<\/strong> received an additional $10,000 for qualifying in two events \u2013 saddle bronc riding and bull riding. The stipend for each NFR contestant counts in the PRCA | RAM World Standings. After Round 1 Thursday, the only leader to change spots in the world standings was in saddle bronc riding. <strong>Ryder Wright<\/strong>, the reigning world champ, scooted past his brother Stetson Wright by $119. Ryder took the lead by placing fourth in Round 1 with an 87-point ride on Hi Lo Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Palindrome and earning $11,321.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NEWS &amp; NOTES<\/strong><br \/>\nIn bareback riding, 2019 PRCA World Champion\u00a0<strong>Clayton Biglow<\/strong>\u00a0looks to bounce back after a slow start in Round 1 on Bridwell Pro Rodeos&#8217; Meat Sweats. Meat Sweats has had three 45-point stock scores this year including an 88.5-point ride from\u00a0<strong>Tim O&#8217;Connell<\/strong>\u00a0earlier this year to pick up a round win at the High Desert Stampede in Redmond, Ore., March 25. Six-time NFR Qualifier\u00a0<strong>Tanner Aus<\/strong>\u00a0looks to earn some money after drawing Calgary Stampede&#8217;s Zig Zag Cherry. The horse enters the NFR with an average score of 84.75 points including a 90.5-point ride from\u00a0<strong>Orin Larsen<\/strong>\u00a0in Round 10 of the Calgary Stampede, July 18\u2026.In the saddle bronc riding, <strong>Stetson Wright<\/strong> matches up with J Bar J&#8217;s In The Lu. During the 2021 ProRodeo season the average score on the horse was 88 points. Fellow Wrangler NFR qualifier <strong>Tegan Smith <\/strong>won the Jordan (Mont.) Match Xtreme Bronc Ride on June 20 with a 92.5-point ride on In The Lu, his highest score of the year. <strong>Wyatt Casper<\/strong> draws Frontier Rodeo&#8217;s Maple Leaf in Round 2. It&#8217;s bucked off 43% of would-be riders this season. Casper posted an 87-point ride on the horse in 2020 at the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo\u2026..In the bull riding, <strong>Sage Kimzey <\/strong>will look to accomplish a feat that&#8217;s never been done in the PRCA. He matches up with Sankey Pro Rodeo &amp; Phenom Genetics&#8217; Arctic Assassin, a bull that&#8217;s never been ridden in ProRodeo during its 18 outs. It&#8217;ll be the first meeting between the two. <strong>Trey Benton III <\/strong>draws another tough task in Harper &amp; Morgan Rodeo&#8217;s Pickup Man in Round 2.
