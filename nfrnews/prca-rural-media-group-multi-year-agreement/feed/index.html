					<description><![CDATA[Patrick,

I have a yearly subscription to the Cowboy Channel Plus and have enjoyed watching the rodeos very much. Of course, after following along every day, now I want to watch the conclusion of the rodeos at the National Finals Rodeo in December. I want to see the final winners.

However, you have made it VERY difficult to sign up for the streaming pass. There are a lot of long explanations, advertisements, etc. but I can&#039;t go directly to the sign up page! It is very frustrating to me. 

I am still searching for the NFR Streaming Pass so I can redeem the coupon I found. I hope I can find it before the Rodeo Finals begin in December!
