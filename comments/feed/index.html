					<description><![CDATA[Patrick,

I have a yearly subscription to the Cowboy Channel Plus and have enjoyed watching the rodeos very much. Of course, after following along every day, now I want to watch the conclusion of the rodeos at the National Finals Rodeo in December. I want to see the final winners.

However, you have made it VERY difficult to sign up for the streaming pass. There are a lot of long explanations, advertisements, etc. but I can&#039;t go directly to the sign up page! It is very frustrating to me. 

I am still searching for the NFR Streaming Pass so I can redeem the coupon I found. I hope I can find it before the Rodeo Finals begin in December!

Tickets for the Wrangler NFR are being sold in blocks of four so that families and close friends can sit together safely. Each block of four seats will be separated to retain healthy physical distance for fans during the rodeo performances. Contact-limiting measures, such as mobile tickets, have been implemented throughout the event. Globe Life Field is also encouraging all guests to check the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services websites for any guideline changes prior to the event.

If the public health situation evolves, there may be additional tickets available. Globe Life Field is working closely with state and local health officials and they have created a wait list for fans if additional tickets become available at www.texasrangers.com/NFR. Fans who sign up for the wait list will be given first opportunity to buy any tickets that might be made available. Limited suite rentals at Globe Life Field are still available for each performance. For information and availability, fans should email specialevents@texasrangers.com or call 972-RANGERS.]]></description>
