<p>French footballer Karim Benzema and Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin<em>AFP</em></p>



<p>Karim Benzema has filed a defamation case against French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. Darmanin accused the 35-year-old French footballer of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood when he condemned Israel&#8217;s attacks on Palestinians last October.</p>



<p>French news agency AFP reported that Benzema&#8217;s lawyer, Hugo Vigier, filed the case in the country&#8217;s special Court of Justice on Tuesday. In this court the proceedings of the cases of the ministers of France were completed.</p>



<p>After the Palestinian independence armed group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Israel began indiscriminate bombing of Gaza in response. When there was a storm of protest in different parts of the world, Benzema also joined in it. The Algerian-born footballer wrote on social media, &#8220;All our prayers are with the residents of Gaza, who are once again the victims of this unjust bombing, where no woman or child is spared.&#8221;</p>



<p>France&#8217;s Interior Minister Darmanin told CNews Channel that the Ballon d&#8217;Or winner Benzema has &#8220;notorious ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.&#8221; The Muslim Brotherhood is a Cairo-based Islamic organization that is currently banned in Egypt. However, the branches of the organization are spread all over the world. Darmanin also accused Benzema of not singing the national anthem at France national team games and proselytizing on social media.Read moreIsraeli footballer arrested for preaching war with Palestine freed</p>



<p>Benzema protested through his lawyer shortly after Darmanin&#8217;s latest allegations. This time he walked the legal path. In the lawsuit, Benzema said, &#8220;He has never had the slightest involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood, and has no idea of ​​anyone claiming to be a member of the organization.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karim Benzema now plays for Saudi Pro League side Al IttihadAFP</p>



<p>Benzema, who is currently playing for the club Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, wrote in the case that he is being used in a political game. The matter is all the more scandalous because the dramatic events since October 7 demand something different from such a statement.&#8217;</p>

<p>Cutting to play BPL for the first time<em>Instagram/Ben Cutting</em></p>



<p>146.96—The number is Ben Cutting&#8217;s strike rate in 209 matches in all forms of T20 cricket. This Australian cricketer of explosive batting will be seen in this year&#8217;s BPL. The 36-year-old pace bowling all-rounder will play for Sylhet Strikers from the beginning of the tournament.</p>



<p>Cutting, who is playing BPL for the first time, has promised his instinctive attacking batting on the soil of Bangladesh. Cutting team Sylhet had its first practice today at Mirpur Sherebangla Stadium. In the pre-practice press conference there, Cutting promised to give the visitors explosive batting, &#8220;Hopefully, you will see some sixes.&#8221; I am waiting to hit the field with bat and ball. Hopefully, I can play some good matches.Read moreStar fair in Rangpur with Shakib-Babar</p>



<p>Cutting can become the main hope of the Sylhet team in this year&#8217;s BPL. Apart from scoring quick runs in the lower order, he also has the ability to play an important role in bowling. The long-bodied pacer&#8217;s extra bounce can come in handy in Sylhet&#8217;s home ground conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-bangla%2F2024-01%2Ff4e77556-9a85-48e0-9f9d-7b39634dcd31%2FIMG_20240117_134759_607.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;format=webp&amp;w=640&amp;dpr=1.3" alt="আজ মিরপুরে সাংবাদিকদের সঙ্গে কথা বলেছেন কাটিং"/></figure>



<p>Cutting spoke to journalists in Mirpur todayProthom-alo</p>



<p>Cutting is also looking at it. Sylhet will play 5 of the 12 matches in the league phase of the BPL at the Sylhet International Stadium. Cutting considers those 5 matches as important to get a place in the play-offs, &#8216;It is difficult to talk about the results before playing a match. Today is our first practice with the whole team. This is exciting for us. Looking forward to the first match. I have heard a lot about this wicket. It is difficult to play on this wicket. After playing two matches here, we will go to Sylhet. We will play in front of our home crowd. You&#8217;ll want to win five out of five matches there, which will smoothen the rest of our tournament.&#8221;Read moreOpener Smith&#8217;s first innings ends at 12 runs</p>



<p>Cutting says that Sylhet&#8217;s team with Mashrafe-Nazmul is very balanced, &#8220;I think our team is very balanced.&#8221; Met most of the cricketers for the first time today. Played against a few of them over the years. Now the experience of playing in the same team will be good. In my opinion, we have a very strong and balanced team. There is a great combination of domestic and foreign cricketers. This is what is demanded in these tournaments.</p>



<p>Before coming to Bangladesh, he also brought a basic idea about the condition, &#8216;(Whatever the wicket is) I have no problem (laughs). I do both batting and bowling. So wicket batting or bowling – helpful – I don&#8217;t have a problem. To be honest I haven&#8217;t heard much about this wicket. But I have watched BPL on TV for many years, I have seen many runs. As the tournament progressed, I saw the spinners taking control most of the time. It is expected in these tournaments.Read moreLion or oblivion, which way Shamar Joseph&#8217;s career will go with the first ball wicket</p>



<p>Cutting is the only Australian cricketer in this year&#8217;s BPL. Earlier, David Warner, Steve Smith, Brad Hodge, Sean Tait have played in BPL. But there was never an Australian dominance in the BPL. There is a logical reason for that. Cutting reminded that, &#8216;At the same time the Big Bash was held in Australia. Except me, very few Australian cricketers can play in other leagues. Probably only 2-1 freelance cricketers can play. The other one is Chris Lynn, he is playing Big Bash. That is the only reason. But I am sure, boys would have enjoyed a lot when they came to play BPL. Many of the Australians could have played if the schedule had not conflicted with the Big Bash.</p>

<p>Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni<em>File photo</em></p>



<p>A defamation case has been filed against India&#8217;s World Cup-winning captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The case was filed in the Delhi High Court by his two former business partners, Mihir Diwakar and Soumya Das, who are also husband and wife. In the suit, a permanent injunction has been sought against Dhoni, various social media platforms and media houses to stop the plaintiffs from defaming and defaming them.</p>



<p>The Times of India reported that the hearing of the defamation case against Dhoni is scheduled for Thursday.</p>



<p>Earlier, Dhoni filed a cheating case against Mihir and Soumya in Ranchi lower court. In the case, the former Indian captain alleged that the defendants violated the contract to establish the cricket academy and caused a loss of around Rs 16 crore. Mihir and Soumya are directors of a sports management company called &#8216;Arka Sports&#8217;.</p>



<p>As per Dhoni&#8217;s claim, an agreement was signed between Arca Sports and Dhoni to launch a cricket academy in 2017. According to the agreement, Arca Sports is obligated to pay a franchise fee and profit sharing. But despite repeated reminders, the company and the accused did not honor the agreement.Read moreBenzema sued the French interior minister</p>



<p>At that time Dhoni&#8217;s friend Simeon Lohani filed a complaint against Diwakar for threatening him.</p>



<p>Tomorrow will give a glimpse of where the situation is going in the counter-argument. The defamation case against Dhoni will be heard in the court of Justice Pratibha M Singh.</p>

<p>Fin Allen&#8217;s batting innings again<em>AFP</em></p>



<p>Zaman Khan&#8217;s slower delivery was an off cutter. He wanted to fly through mid wicket with a cross bat. Ball-bat did not hit properly, bold&#8230;.</p>



<p>Finn Allen couldn&#8217;t get this one shot right at University Oval in Dunedin. In his previous 61-ball spell, the Kiwi opener hit the world record of sixes in an innings in T20Is. Allen hit 16 sixes in the third T20 of the series against Pakistan today, playing a 62-ball 137-run innings.</p>



<p>The record for the most sixes in an innings in T20 International was held by Hazratullah Zazai so far. The Afghanistan opener hit 16 sixes en route to a 162-run innings against Ireland in Dehradun in 2019.</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s 137 is also New Zealand&#8217;s individual highest innings in T20 Internationals. The Kiwi opener broke Brendon McCullum&#8217;s record. McCullum scored 123 off 58 balls against Bangladesh at Pallekele in the 2012 T20 World Cup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-bangla%2F2024-01%2F612ac234-eafd-4e90-9b35-a8dbcf39d3d6%2F309442_01_02.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;format=webp&amp;w=640&amp;dpr=1.3" alt="৪৮ বলে তিন অঙ্ক ছুঁয়েছেন ফিন অ্যালেন"/></figure>



<p>Finn Allen reached three figures in 48 ballsAFP</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s innings is the fifth highest in 20-over international cricket and the highest against Pakistan. The previous highest was also by a Kiwi batsman against Pakistan. Mark Chapman was unbeaten on 104 off 52 balls in Rawalpindi last April.Read moreWilliamson&#8217;s series ends against Pakistan</p>



<p>Allen touched three figures in 48 balls before being dismissed in the 18th over. This is the third fastest for a New Zealander. Glenn Phillips scored a 46-ball century and Colin Munro scored a 47-ball century. Both at Mt Manganui, against the West Indies. Phillips in 2020, Monroe in 2018.</p>



<p>Haris Rauf suffered the most from Allen&#8217;s 16 sixes today. Pakistan&#8217;s right-arm pacer hit 6 sixes, including 3 in the sixth over. Rauf gave a total of 28 runs in that over.</p>
