<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of the World Darts Championship</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dennis Priestley to Michael Smith: A Legacy of Champions</h3>



<p>The roots of the World Darts Championship trace back to 1994, with Dennis Priestley claiming the inaugural title. Phil Taylor then dominated the scene, securing a staggering fourteen titles between 1995 and 2013. However, new champions emerged, including Michael van Gerwen, Gary Anderson, and the defending champion, Michael Smith.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Spectacle of Nine Darters</h3>



<p>A highlight of the championship is the elusive nine-darter, a perfect leg. From Raymond van Barneveld&#8217;s historic moment in 2009 to Michael Smith&#8217;s recent feat in 2023, we explore the mesmerizing instances of perfection that have graced Alexandra Palace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Favorites for the World Title</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Luke Humphries: The Rising Star</h3>



<p>In a surprising turn of events, Luke Humphries has emerged as the top favorite for the world title. With three major titles in just 49 days, including the World Grand Prix and Players Championship Finals, can &#8220;Cool Hand Luke&#8221; carry this exceptional form to secure his first world title?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and Contenders</h3>



<p>While Michael van Gerwen and Gerwyn Price aim for a resurgence, defending champion Michael Smith remains a wildcard. Gary Anderson, once written off, has staged a remarkable comeback, adding intrigue to the list of contenders. The unpredictable nature of darts ensures that even outsiders like Rob Cross, Nathan Aspinall, and James Wade cannot be discounted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where to Watch the Championship</h2>



<p>For enthusiasts eager to catch the action live, Sky Sports in the UK is the go-to channel. With comprehensive coverage on Sky Sports Arena and occasional sessions on Sky Sports Main Event, fans can witness the drama unfold from the comfort of their homes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prize Money Breakdown</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Whopping 2.5 Million in Prize Money</h3>

<p>The darting world is gearing up for a heartwarming twist at the 2024 World Darts Championship, courtesy of Paddy Power. In a surprising move, the Irish bookmakers have abandoned the idea of turning the treble 20 bed green, opting instead to donate £1,000 to Prostate Cancer UK for every 180 hit during the tournament. Let&#8217;s delve into the details of this &#8216;Big 180&#8217; campaign and its potential impact on both the darts community and the fight against prostate cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Initial Jest: Treble 20 Turning Green?</h2>



<p>Paddy Power initially sent shockwaves through the darting community by playfully announcing that the treble 20 bed would change from its traditional red color at Alexandra Palace. However, this quirky twist was revealed to be a cleverly orchestrated jest, setting the stage for a more profound and meaningful initiative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The &#8216;Big 180&#8217; Campaign Unveiled</h2>



<p>Contrary to the lighthearted banter, the true intent of the &#8216;Big 180&#8217; campaign is now unveiled. With 901 maximums hit during the previous World Darts Championship, Paddy Power aims to surpass this figure, pledging a potential £1 million donation to Prostate Cancer UK. The money raised throughout the championship, scheduled to be broadcast live on Sky Sports from December 15, will fund crucial research to diagnose men sooner and improve the lives of those affected by prostate cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration for a Cause: Paddy Power and Professional Darts Corporation (PDC)</h2>



<p>In a commendable joint effort, Paddy Power and the Professional Darts Corporation are set to leverage their channels, challenging 180,000 fans, followers, and customers in the UK to use Prostate Cancer UK&#8217;s online risk checker via prostatecanceruk.org/180-risk. This collaborative approach aims to raise awareness and encourage proactive measures against the most common cancer in men.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Apology and the Purpose</h2>



<p>Acknowledging the potential stress caused to players like Peter Wright and Michael van Gerwen, a Paddy Power spokesperson officially apologizes while emphasizing the greater cause. With one in eight men at risk of prostate cancer, the goal is to hit the bullseye with &#8216;The Big 180&#8217; campaign, making it unmissable this Christmas and prompting men to take a mere 30 seconds to check their risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PDC&#8217;s Perspective: A Risk Worth Taking</h2>



<p>Matthew Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation, reflects on the risk taken by Paddy Power in pranking players to garner public attention. However, the ultimate goal is clear — to encourage millions of viewers to take a brief moment during the World Darts Championship to assess their risk of prostate cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prostate Cancer UK&#8217;s CEO Speaks Out</h2>



<p>Laura Kerby, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, expresses gratitude for becoming the official charity partner of the Paddy Power World Darts Championship. Positioned at the heart of the action, &#8216;The Big 180&#8217; is poised to be a gamechanger, supporting men and their loved ones affected by prostate cancer, one maximum at a time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Champion&#8217;s Testimony: Dennis Priestley</h2>



<p>Dennis Priestley, a two-time world champion who battled prostate cancer, joins the campaign. Having been diagnosed in November 2007 and successfully treated, Priestley becomes a living testament to the importance of early diagnosis. He asserts that nearly all cancers, including prostate cancer, can be beaten if caught early enough.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Players&#8217; Pledge and Incentives</h2>



<p>Peter Wright, the 2020 and 2022 PDC world champion, underscores the significance of knowing the risk of prostate cancer for men over 50. As players gear up for the championship, each maximum hit translates to a £1,000 donation to Prostate Cancer UK, providing an extra incentive to perform well on the darts stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In the spirit of the season and competitive darts, Paddy Power&#8217;s &#8216;Big 180&#8217; campaign intertwines sportsmanship with a noble cause. The synergy between sponsors, players, and fans creates a unique platform to raise awareness about prostate cancer and contribute significantly to ongoing research and support initiatives.</p>
